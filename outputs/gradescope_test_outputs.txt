So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best moment, and you need to put systems on its site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> to all make in medical decisions, and in fact for financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to benefit from that would benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack on the heart itself.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and it knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even if you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even want less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
Number one should be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's God's fault. It's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the more widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they can help somebody get a person?
300.
This as the research of the <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why no not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> Okay?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of patients.
And those include things that include <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the data chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken them five percent of the 300 percent have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that the drug will help you.
I don't say they should or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with their doctors.
Human ethics is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this necessary number of trying to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men in the top men in the <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So, 49 surgeries for a person who has ever helped.
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time before the questions that you can ask that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option a lot of times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk about and they think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> and one of the things that happens at the time is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predator, you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could get to the lunch lunch so that none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and their colleagues have been shown.
So we have to be able to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think of the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help you to minimize whether or to prevent things bad in the first place.
I took on the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of a combination next to the door, with a key to the entry door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't seen and lots of mail that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> I would never get to do with a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the 1800s, and over the time time we mixed with local signals, and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, they prescribe behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned, for example ...
"Not <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating a bag of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, if you're eating, covered in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> for continue.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I'm doing it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why my drawings are just four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was an hearing.
Now sound has gone into my territory of art.
Is it going to become more about the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the name of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the way to sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as to become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask for <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as a kind of a loan for a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue with this practice, I feel like I could <unk> it in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium is <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, musical note cannot capture and express in the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you can understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> split up in many different parameters <unk>
If you're assigned a different parameter for each finger as the facial expression, the <unk> the body movement, the speed, the speed, the shape of hand and so on, while the piano, English is a linear, linear language, as if it was <unk> just a key at the same time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> would create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> to use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I began to think, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and it took it over, and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun and <unk>
This is the day."
If you put it up, and you know, the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to be said <unk>
"All afterward.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents the time in <unk> and how far the distance to body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present is two hands closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to make a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of your hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please fix it again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest -- but make it very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't automatically have social value.
We have to start asking what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a society more <unk>
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> You don't have to hear the music.
The <unk> is a rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up each other.
The country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the Chinese school <unk>
I don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, and then we got these pieces of plastic to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous ships.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel neat and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave you with imagination from my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just information information.
And by using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children would get into a lot of robots.
Then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we made lamps and camera cameras and <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see these pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would take it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I looked at my problem: But my students in Hong Kong are children very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get together with this image: <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using your hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is affecting the water where the water is where they live.
You can also see the water is brown and the oil and the oil are also <unk> and when you all <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most people, in the moment, it looks safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to <unk> every year from the crash and research in a independently of other scientists, the soil, the river, and we wanted to take the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we informed the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem to be not done seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is going to be absorbed from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this organized a civil expedition, the closer to the nuclear power to date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles from the nuclear power, and with the fishermen help of the area of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea with a marker to sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem: a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, a little bit of biology, basically you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of advanced population transforming their standard wheelchair in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, scientists, creators, we should prepare to the next generation for us to care about the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made from thousands of steel pieces of steel -- the other one silk silk dragline is.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One is imposes over the environment, the other thing thought it was.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that <unk>
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and organized architects to think their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with continuous <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with small <unk>
You can mostly act as a filter -- the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually through the variation of <unk>
Here is a split screen that represents my view of the world <unk> the double personality of every designer and an architect at working on between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and synthesis, it shows in the two screens after me.
My job in your simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, Why now?
Why couldn't this be about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special time in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offers to designers that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and tools and tools like this robotic arm with a <unk> scope of diameter with a <unk> base of diameter with a direct base of <unk> buildings, and graphics to nanoscale made from <unk> genetically altered that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is only size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion -- it's going to be <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with a 3D printing remote printing -- we print this layer and print it out of the cells. I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This <unk> and rigid and soft helmet in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical analytical and the instruments of <unk> it allows us to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor -- my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
They vary this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, it makes its functionality not by addition to other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously property property.
But it's the natural nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jew home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and was going to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and branches and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with twigs, including water and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if the objects were made of a single part?
<unk> to a better state of the <unk>
So we're looking for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought if we could tune into the <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We could achieve chemical <unk> we have been able to achieve a broad range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on the scale, it built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made of a single material -- <unk> feet long, 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, you dry it to dry it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet <unk> a billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it grows even further, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure of <unk> <unk> into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best product for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life -- and placed on the ground, they will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the ability to create clothes for <unk>
To do that, we must dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made by <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals are <unk> new biological <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these engineered crops.
In our first piece of laundry -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
A turns light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the tract <unk> that will help the flow of these bacteria and to bring their way into their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the natural functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we have more transparent.
This system called <unk> <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our tiny gut lives.
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We're newborn creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increased our <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer, it prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly effective architecture -- a home within which it is <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which fibers are <unk>
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first comes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would take a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that shape the <unk> the structure of <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> and we could create these things.
So we brought this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk worms is going to be more dark and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat down, -- silk worms about structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to relate to us.
We put them very carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> they got <unk> and they got eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
By combining biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion out of its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles away.
On a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk route as well.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 pounds in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers should bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new design era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature of us, which demands of us, for the first time, that let's take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked this?
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English school, the <unk> and the art and developed websites -- and then he was playing the guitar in a punk rock called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I usually like to test and persist anyway, so having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it's getting to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I transferred to the other thing, something totally different, and I get involved in it, and I'm going to get off and I feel <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and we would give them to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me was not <unk> at all.
I was worried about engagement, or to be embarrassed or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to get back then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned from culture.
You ask us what you want to be <unk>
When we have five years old.
And the truth is that no one cares about what they would go to that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice responses in children like, to be <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> students to high school students ask them to go to the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before you take away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, just the other way, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, but even as much as you are <unk> you might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And this Amy editor turned into <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear about is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The whole life notion is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that every one of us has something to do anything to do in its time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and I spend your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What happens if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath of <unk>
It could help if you divide it into three parts: multiple <unk> <unk>
You can also use other terms that you would have the same idea, as you can <unk> <unk>
So during the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
You know, any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization of data, travels and design and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired jewelry.
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's why new ideas come from?
And <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these vantage points.
The second superpower <unk> is fast learning.
When we <unk> we are <unk> we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it's been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we would have, so rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time ago, and a full-time writer.
As a little pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he become a writer, I was a <unk> a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write a compelling volunteer for the editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to have a waste of time to do that even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes <unk> of videos, a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter, and sometimes teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes good work.
He's even more valuable because you can take a lot of different roles depending on your <unk>
magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can help them to meet the needs of the market needs, the ones that really make them.
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you might lose if they're a <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a big interest in encourage <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need political thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deeper and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are going to deal with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part are encouraging them to simply be surprised to be more like their <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing you take out of this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all over the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I'm like, <unk> with your lots of passions.
Keep her curious to be curious about those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric disorder.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, and unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird <unk> in the brain of a guy that had never seen before.
What's even more shocking,
If <unk> had been living today, we couldn't give her more help than the <unk> gave her <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> the medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral cancer, <unk> for <unk> and so much more.
But little progress has been made on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the ability to contract is almost one in two of them.
In other words, there is the probability of passing their years with Alzheimer's disease or helping care of a friend or loved to Alzheimer's.
In the U.S. alone, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on disease disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> increase in five times in the year by 2050, as we get the generation of the <unk> boom.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first leading causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have spent less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but everybody else is <unk> Alzheimers is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, disease <unk> with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to an Alzheimer's disease to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage caused by Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's has found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper it folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> are <unk>
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physicists, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when these drugs were <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms -- at an early stage, then we see that they would go and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to make that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to think that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have collected more research and <unk> pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones -- day and night, are often too <unk> to come out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times, in January Times, in January of this year.
To love someone, you do this.
The article is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience when we test it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two weird <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal questions and then you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And we <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> I'm really excited about -- Tell your partner what you like to do, or she would her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you would never say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget of the participants that two of the participants had married six months later and invited across the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we got rid of and   And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the column that I was going to be a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you may be wondering, do they go together <unk>
And the reason I think this is why I think this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me about writing about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably probably have a couple of those.
And that came up with a relatively new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper was posted on a Friday night, and at night, I came up with the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday already had already called the "Today Show and "Good Good <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was to say something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing as an understanding of <unk> but something else is to discover that the loving life of an international news has been an international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called them or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, the same question: are they still following together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And so many messages they showed up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this one.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international community, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> for orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons I was afraid of the <unk> process, a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked worked out, they wanted to know if they were really able to produce love -- but if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and he felt, especially people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you could go together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for managing interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But I study it worked.
The participants were found closer after doing that, several later studies, they also used the protocol <unk> <unk> as a fast way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community -- and they've used it with people from the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried to test last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this article, but unfortunately never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> I tried the study and didn't work.
He looked like it for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you love the person who would be <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> who were able to get better understood after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, I said. I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to do all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I went to the science.
And I did all of what I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain way to make the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did this for the book I would write -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought if I was built with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I sat then.
And this whole knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than <unk>
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I can demand me.
What I'm looking for about love is a <unk> not just to be happy today and to be happy tomorrow, but to continue to be beloved indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they were even together.
The story told the media about 36 questions that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to mitigate some sense of risk <unk> and this is a very scary story because in love with us to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, would you submit that let's ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known thing, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> the love didn't happen.
He was in love with in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading now, not because it's not true, but at the moment, there was no matter what that choice was.
I didn't think how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how much times I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always choosing or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and say, 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as generous, kind and kind of fun and to have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe really.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he would also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> full mountain, and in a way I came as a <unk> of the forest.
One of New York City does a time time --  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box of wood, and you put a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some weird <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going to <unk> and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> I took the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of a way that it seemed to be that it goes up to size, as if it was to be able to get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, these strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow back up, draw the same thing around a <unk> <unk>
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals <unk>
First of all, you will tell you what an idea will be done.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in human form, sculptures of the natural size of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and the other window and other window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked out, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big that I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> kilos.
<unk> meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all of these creatures with head of animals travel between two worlds.
You're in the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the harsh bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if they look very well in the ocean.
In all ways, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while on the other hand you get clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like <unk> which holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail long tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why that was going.
Things that go by, you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made out of terrorist cards.
They've been <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my final project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is a archive of our culture, through media and material or material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human <unk> in their inside.
This has a little cave in my chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get <unk>
I'll be linked by the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that it covers your penis or <unk> or whatever it is, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick test of these works because I can't run it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physical, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician a musician, a writer, a <unk> selling arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all the people in <unk> each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living on.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, from the borders, of religion, not work.
We are all very handmade.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and sweetness -- we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill it has effect against pain, first happens by your stomach, your bowels and other organs.
It will take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug has effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that by the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are available to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and it will increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on its side effects -- mostly negative, because in the time that it gets to the current current to get to your blood current -- and even for the time that it takes to get to its destiny, which is where it's more important, in the store of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. the nervous system the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go into the bloodstream.
However, after the death disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment treatment treatment for an oral life.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> facial diabetes, you can be used for anything to <unk> including drug transport for medicines.
We're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes -- that open and close and closed the cells infected with HIV to introduce the drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful laser beam on the cell membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups are not armed with armed organizations like terrorists, and insurgents or <unk>
They are doing what these groups do when they're not shoot out.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence generators.
I work from the field, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors and actors not government actors.
For example, the <unk> deals peace deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what these organizations motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known by his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s in 1980, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian -- known for their suicide bombers known by their suicide bombers also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
We would take a complex machinery of communication stations online stations, radio channels, websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
Prisoners groups also invest in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Their armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties to their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put hospitals, professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Their armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not providing security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, electoral victory in 2006 cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid groups.
<unk> because they fill gaps from the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and the governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, less we can do it as opposed to a state.
How is a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all of their functions, collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from <unk> nations and <unk> and the smaller the states are states, like in the Middle East today, more inclusive, and fill that gap the actors of actors <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
<unk> that government emptiness has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and to establish the peace.
If we understand groups better, we'll understand better what incentives will offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, actors can win some fights, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that security, to fill that of the government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label that would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was thinking about it as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> who might be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I was fascinated by a woman who is not following the rules, which is asking too much to self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and he can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also <unk>
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would make the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as the free of <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use in a easy way and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music -- just volume.
Although the letter degrades women and <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
Would you actually get your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical technologies.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  -- all of the tasks <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of junk -- the <unk> and the nest maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
And the <unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales, which are being done.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, is his choice, and I'm not who I am to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, to raise that choice as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of color, the <unk> working and <unk> for white women and high school.
<unk> if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist brain.
It also happens this: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we would be able to make it right.
When we <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I consider that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid of being <unk> as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear of what it means <unk> by fear that he would not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Let's take a <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In the Canadian Music Video: 2014, he acted in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a show <unk> to see this star of the pop star embracing feminism and doing the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started debates that started arguing about it or not a feminist issue.
He took their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We're going to go much beyond the sane and a constructive constructive to <unk> Feminism for any woman, <unk> until nothing to remain nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, an feminism more inclusive is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make the change affecting effectively their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why does your music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to, and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two little girls and <unk> and <unk> and too brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where you get to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about the sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case -- men, especially old white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish on your magazine, to participate in his project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include enough enough of women, so much to participate in the way to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your desktop or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage in these kinds of projects, we can also help participate in this type of projects, and we can also help us to be even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> we have no <unk> Without these efforts, without adopting these <unk> our accomplishments will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to people in power directors, and film producers and music, <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and significant change.
We can also be able to tell our courage -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist at <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because <unk> my voice was stolen and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A couple of guys <unk> when I was so young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I get involved in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could be told and see me and realizing that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue the humbling reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad problem: I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had measles to have seen <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went across the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that measles can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily self-sustainable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was not supposed to be <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article that sparked about autism and vaccines and vaccines for being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will be in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the expansion of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard of her creating their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to stable just three or four children for each other.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising like <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could give it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of his son of two years, the eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk>
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and focus on science that with the <unk> power.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what the autism is, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark sides of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> closed worlds, <unk> people on their own parents.
They could be fun for hours by shaking their hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic for <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as major authority in the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as we were <unk> from places as distant as South Africa.
This is really not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he realized that he had become nine of every 10 children by sent by other doctors to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
And we put autism as a form of psychotic child -- caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept so carefully in a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents, desperate to win their approval at all.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without support, special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service of Health that they needed more resources for the autistic children and their families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
<unk> a study of prevalence in autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more expensive, diverse and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful pictures and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have no <unk> of these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was translated to her.
The document provides an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a <unk> clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games on Saturday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability for life that required <unk> ways of support and <unk> spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, "Hey, they called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of others, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known as the awkward social scientist and the awkward social scientist <unk>
He was more there until I mean, for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by <unk> <unk>
These changes don't fell into a broken bag.
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked around us to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, I used to know what autism, but after <unk> acting as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, the first easy health tests to use to diagnose autism.
I should not have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that they were hoping that they are, by making the people with autism and their families finally support support and services that would be <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame for vaccines for the increase in the <unk> a simple, powerful, and seductive story of the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart center that one in every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new political advances.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> standards, normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt, people are struggling to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still making something that I believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding teachers, employers with capacity, communities communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the boat from the <unk>
As we walk into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
