You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, I read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather clothes, and no one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally was something that fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I was beaten up to bleed every week in the bathroom every week, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me get into the bathroom in the living room.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that teacher -- the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm glad we never got to know us.
You could <unk> Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you about please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see us, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got out of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult arrived at <unk> it became a <unk> box and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today to talk a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can be fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> going around around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think this was a <unk> on another <unk> on a year <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall off the glaciers or break barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to hold themselves up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts, I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg comes out, a iceberg releases fresh water from minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way, and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is a <unk> iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually see a <unk> iceberg to see.
Here it is.
You can see the left one boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so you put the iceberg out a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if they stop to think about a conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my soil I would get two roles.
In one of my roles work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy of the anatomy -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered <unk> the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics challenge social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins two people within one body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male and conventional <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having sex that are not <unk> in the common form of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> <unk> which <unk> gene from the chromosome. And it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that are <unk>
And then, in life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't depend on testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops up following a <unk> course.
When you <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when somebody realizes something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having ovaries and <unk> it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women like men, we have a body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman, who does not know its <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that had the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old kid who was born and raised like <unk> had girlfriend, and married sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a boy and he had just discovered that he had ovaries, he was <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- they were so active that they were essentially creating a foreign hormone environment.
As a result, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it went to the age of 19 when he started having the <unk> medical problems by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> which is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know well why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- they are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> they are tested to surgery that is not to be able to be able to get a physical health of physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are tested to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- it's black wants to say African anatomy in terms of <unk> terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you presented us a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very tight ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within one body.
The most high case is last year with the past year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder, "What do you test to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we more need to admit that these categories are -- we thought of these are a stable <unk> categories that are protected directly by <unk> categories -- are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we <unk> from the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved through science and more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture today, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I do within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to relate to this question if somebody was dead.
As a lot of <unk> put a pen in front of the nose, and if it moved still not to <unk>
And if he stopped moving around it.
But today we can, for example, we can take vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining it, and this is actually placed in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual objects, but I have to admit that you get nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
It was from the point of view of a concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find out every while seeing that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did was -- it was a <unk> concept and we had it, with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The <unk> of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had a clear idea of a birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they came up with political power by the right of blood transmitted from the grandfather and then the son, etc.
The <unk> had rejected that idea and replaced it by a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered in common the anatomy of common and not <unk> -- that was a very radical thing.
And they were partly doing it because they were part of a self-organizing system where they were getting two things.
It was <unk> the democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> out of <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to get passed off by a kind of vague <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and nature of God.
They talk about power from nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future of Human Rights
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what did years then?
And women were <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to go to the <unk> coincidence of the difference that again, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the mutation, we have to start asking asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we need to focus on anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five was supposed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me makes sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary. were born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, on the contrary, I was born on the March 1 in March 1980.
For the fact that we only were born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We find some other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, the virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, because of the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that are still <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science was able to do so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science will <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of attitude we say, "Well, we need to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas has now decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman to have Y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do tests for the people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do people judge the contents of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I should be able to do this for <unk> rights to people, because I've just to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships that people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is continuing to guiding this current thinking about democracy.
We've done good work in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian man who is attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless it's willing to be willing to have a change of sex, in which case is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth fraternal twins to then pick it out, and then they <unk> their name.
But when the phone asked him, I asked her for the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, I said in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be those who are <unk> to change the sake of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement to the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a <unk> and it's that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> in particular, if you're thinking about a group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in finding the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from studies of studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in the feminism -- I considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk> approach.
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unraveling gender stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about the question, most of the people have seemed to me that there is something in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people in the state, it's possible that there will be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect competition, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think about where to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily reduce the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But we just went through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that to the other half is still <unk> to do it.
You could try to increase the ability to <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building reductions.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, build a new apartment building -- always and when the standards of that place is going to build the construction instead of putting them <unk>
And so I proposed that governments were going to have new areas of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent, they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential election, <unk> <unk> imposed with a platform in which I promised reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under charter to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
So we have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like norms to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable cities are cities, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> wherever in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, and he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described to me in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a charter that <unk> the rules that will be <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going on.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will <unk> at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government aid leaders could benefit from the countries associated with the country that would help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they could all be confident that they could all be <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is out there.
It could be easily through a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional available to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, voting in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
In order to get it in the Constitution -- it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed it again in another voting or <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting at age 21, <unk> <unk> for about two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is built in Korea <unk> it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other interested in building is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban urban <unk> and <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go to get a job -- and sometimes they are lonely mothers who have to make money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that, I live with the <unk>
I love to find himself, and more recently, to photograph and publish and publish and post on my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
And the second hand stores allow me to reduce my <unk> impact on the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> by how general my money goes into good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
Would you like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what can you get someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> within exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED <unk>   that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with the Sunday.
This is what I call a brilliant tiger brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see that great for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red pants here.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just let you tell you, also <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child coming in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be that I play the <unk> or I remember to her little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is key.
If you think you look well with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside person, you don't look that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth -- six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a single personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people came up to me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this isn't going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists, quantum physicists, we need a lot of logic to make them complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make these experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be just in one place at once.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and he didn't do it very well, they always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that TV bar taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago: you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit very well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to scale it a little bit a little bit -- it's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a small little bit of metal, a way of springboard and <unk> supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of <unk> swimming under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up up, I get to do those things, because I don't want to tell you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> <unk> of the inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that goes on and the wind on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to take all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They took the lights down, then they would take a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than one degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, they were vibrating. And the way they <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft power, we were able to make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, every single trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still up and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
I mean, it's worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal piece is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, this is my kind of logic that you're talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights out, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator actually just are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot of talk about that quantum mechanics says everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that <unk>
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a lot of education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I began to travel and go to museums, and I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you a demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look at all the museums that there are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> -- Van <unk>
I am actually going to go into one of my favorites, by <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the plane, and, with one click, we jump in.
They're inside, you want to go in the end of the hall.
follow forward. What do you do?"
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't gotten to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million viruses.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get to 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really can do with 10,000 million viruses.
You can zoom in around very simple ways.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started to play, and I found something happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks <unk>
I walked in and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're quickly going to jump to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh is actually created this <unk>
It goes down and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
Let me show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part -- it's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can online create your own museum, create his own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, you even come from the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium it does justice to its work and it's represented on online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
So I have something to show you.
Think of it's a <unk> a flying <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened very interesting about living racing careers in the last two decades.
Now some time ago, if you wanted to win a year ago, one, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering -- you know, you have a real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that today's control systems are beginning to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to answer differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I want to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms were going to become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it down to the Moses -- you can still see a little bit of a <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> non <unk> -- and so what don't you <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> insisting on the idea of taking the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the effect.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of <unk>
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were playing Italy and France, and in the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people around here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call and go into the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She loves Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winner of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to be a great party, you can see the summit at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we would not have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> are not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a <unk> how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags that track the trash in their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same as much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist yet.
They're going on things complicated things and there are lots of transport.
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not disappears, it's still somewhere in the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we cut one day is still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote any change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
Everything started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and south Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, you join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> valves -- which is open and <unk>
It creates as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you run the pixels the pixels you can write on them, show patterns, images, texts.
And the curtain is going to open up so that we can see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot like this.
And we put a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you come up with it opens up for you to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost all architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
You see the people who are going on in what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you pass out, but a building that was still making <unk> and water holes and you had to jump out to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of these projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
This kind of flexible screen screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixel up.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine the screen appear on different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D pixels that you can reach, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input from people, from the movement of the people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dance dancers today, the star of the New York City <unk> and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements in 3D and use it as entry for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> you see it in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> in real time as it captures movement.
It can spread all the movement.
You can run all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm like domestic <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could do that we would all take a little bit of <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we pass from the physical world to the digital world.
We've collected everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Now, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will tell us, we can move from the digital world of the power of <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this might we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, differently.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but on the <unk>
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve the main moments of the 2010 Olympics and even more, and can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
as if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than <unk>
Suppose I would tell you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, be stronger to have a <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure themselves?
How about to live more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that you <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most -- that makes me feel well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you the look for a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> Church, <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense except to the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is the other or about us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in one end, is, of course, the most interested in it.
We had a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like the human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> from the one that comes out of the time.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> do you with the <unk> think of <unk>
The gut is an amazing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want to be able to want no effort to their part.
It's actually like a quick pathway to the bacteria with casual disruption of some rush clock, into the exit.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in sort of an evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and unique <unk> and human life, a little note of funny.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty in biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the life of life, in the <unk> organisms just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two extra cells.
But when the organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of death in the body goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have a confession to make. which when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year I was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his hotel doors.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a gorgeous little dancer.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to reclaim health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let me fall into the sea.
I think that all of us <unk> the feeling that we put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to say <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the most intelligent and even <unk>
Evolution favors the better adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish there, and yet they've managed to make it a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead, at the stage, I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the reasoning behind it would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that we get to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it's no longer possible to have the impact that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional kind, natural species, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution can turn slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when we kind of <unk> distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility, intriguing and frightening.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose for individual and family level.
Think about that if it could be able to choose not just sex with their <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Would you want to make those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and she sued 13.
<unk> million dollars.
Next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 dollars in a week.
It's not going to be a lot of a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly at the grasp of everyone.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the flu vaccine in a plant plant.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two other little <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or to change the newborn <unk> and give your children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating <unk> to eliminate <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology is that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to be able to also allow us to adopt <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could put it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a lower muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could be 100 thousand years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or their grandchildren in their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful.
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more uniform and more robust and more robust and <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before I could do that, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a <unk> seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one who could talk to the flight assistants with you.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot would take the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not the <unk>
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to set it up.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is when I was <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, "I really feel like a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also gave up my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I <unk> in things that doesn't matter to people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I got into that, I decided to get rid of the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I was born, I had the feeling of, <unk> not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And I was awarded another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back to live differently.
You guys are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that you can imagine the same thing happens to you in your airplane -- and please don't be that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that you still expect to do because they think they're going to be <unk>
How do your relations change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that I ever had.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after he running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis, today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design design and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to speak to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's capable of communicating with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that you see Stephen <unk> is not that all the people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're important and have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of I signed a check that had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I joined his brother and his father there at that very precise time, "All right, well, this is the Tony Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside their inner can't be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer are drawn on that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization move the things from one side to another one of us did a couple of things.
One, I touch the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine so that I could give you a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy with the guy gets an email from him, and you say, "You don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, and the kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and <unk> and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were back, they would have taken off the boxes on the walls and then they would have <unk>
But for two weeks -- we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of cheap sun <unk> we bought at the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free for free -- and now there's a device that's free -- we published the code -- we published the code <unk> the software is low for free.
And we created a device that doesn't have limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after more than one year of planning, two weeks of programming all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed to the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and somebody finally came to <unk> and would get me out of there so that I could make it happen.
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to fix it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized it as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my thought: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing that there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us to do every day when we find something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not right now, when? And if I'm not me, whoever is that if I'm not me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very difficult and as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
They were living in areas of hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only a fun -- just a lot of fun in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been dealing with some situations in situations where I look horrible with the only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that make <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that looked <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you can have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk 2011.
What had was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about what it comes to and the content could be in the face, especially if I put it ridiculous to you or your company at doing it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity for this.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have done it for certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we examined the world for marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be able to do it -- nothing as difficult as it could be in the rooms with these guys.
I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that deals with the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and the whole film is <unk> with <unk> of marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, it has images of <unk> all the time; from the <unk> that comes out before the title of the title of the <unk>
Now this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we take all the categories that we could on the film.
You may have a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you've ever heard.
The most cool car you've ever driven in "The <unk> the largest ever <unk> the best <unk> you've got <unk> <unk> from "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then at addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Doing the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the finished film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all shot from beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people will be to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> very <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that the movie comes up to us, look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I said, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yes. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of it.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
No want to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media -- it's not the idea to tell that new <unk> vehicle that's going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it actually something that changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that odd bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and I tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want to make a story, and we want to make a story, but we would have story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie in some lie -- and there he is him looking at it as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to go to <unk> and go to companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to figure out -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big movies big, giant giants and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies a big Hollywood movies, they say the reason why their movies have so much successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The <unk> <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time for an interview with somebody I can say you're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you with you.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And I will offer you one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, strong, <unk> in his bar, whatever.
That's the overall look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
You can go into the kind of smaller movies that we are doing -- we're rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people of the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something universally cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you fresh longer time?
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of common?
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: It'll revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the type of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors -- many gray colors and things like this.
Usually I wear accessories like sunglasses, or <unk> I like <unk> and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: Some of you are partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They would provide toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Nation <unk> failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I am an automotive brand as well.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we are going to <unk> like people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case they start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: that's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like <unk> I like weird things.
A: <unk> from the <unk> to what do you do that?
What is the <unk> What phase are you right now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
I would get a little bit about that.
<unk> little more of you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy crazy things.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality.
They worked very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies only get involved in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid the things that they are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them to become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are this?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there's playful marks and <unk> all those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand is your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your <unk> identity, your personality of brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk> attribute of it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystic or mystic and mystical <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional term: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are good, stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they didn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the end.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now use MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain so for commercial marketing and film centers.
We went to San Paulo where ad advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are getting way into the schools in the U.S. problems.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I have more successful are those in which I have to do with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their <unk> and they said, maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost every rating agencies that we talked about to their customers will not be part.
And I have always believed that if you take the risks, that at those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out of the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train their employees in the <unk> of the risk is preparing their entire company to be being <unk>
I feel that what is going to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> <unk> fear. <unk>
From a <unk> we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> introduces <unk> the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, let's put in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> for TED next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm. It's actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes you see are control systems in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus on Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enter the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like you want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these <unk> systems.
That struck us the attention -- and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very weird things.
<unk> became <unk> as a rat rat who didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that place: too.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better that we would make the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed with people that obviously had all the internal information.
They <unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What were looking at the first thing that we were looking at was calls in the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to engage them with the real world with potential goals of the real world.
We need to theories about recipients that we can pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely an violent <unk> has to be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and asked them in an effort by <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
And rotor it's that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can actually <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number two: shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So it wasn't like this.
So the results have been from after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> would be to just one and better goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals being <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really struck me.
There is the gray, and up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of entry for sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with false data from <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds out of video video.
It's cool <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth control room.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the massive steam turbine goes away from speed, you have to open <unk> from escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, of course.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> or the security system <unk>
That out.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> of uranium.
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this load with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
You could make it as much as possible.
And if you do that, with what <unk> is with a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of targets.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public on a lot of sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk>
There's one only, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give them <unk> or other than make users of their wheelchair and raise them and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, it gives you a big force, which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually true integration of man and machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and plug it up with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on her back to a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human
Soldier: With the brain-controlled exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 pounds for lots of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and running very large <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new thing this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's now go back to the search users of the wheelchair, so I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the entire population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talked about something that happens very often, very young people on the spine that will start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets broken up quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some more."
And this has been like this for the past 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the <unk> column, and as a result, he couldn't go back to walk for 19 years to now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> to <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches who sends signals to board, here on the back.
There are also a little bit of batteries that give them energy to the <unk> on the <unk> and they make it advance with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing costs down the bottom up, <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all <unk> movement.
A few time later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down on <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just of soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the users of the wheels, everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have sex with sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos of rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big guys, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the less <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario from a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation makes you can't fill up with a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes, the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us, and for us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobos you see the roots <unk> the same as the dance, and the dance and the human imagination.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case, I love it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as far as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing elements unusual things to play -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> -- maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female female who's playing with <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we play ourselves, and explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples from the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world to greater creativity and bigger cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes what we need to play.
But do we find our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
<unk> is critical.
To bonobos and humans alike, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which it is the most urgent thing.
And so, classmates primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers would have a highly specialized staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career against other volunteers to get to the captain to get the captain to charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> he was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that surely <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>   he came up to the captain first to the captain and he asked him to go through and would save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live live just because I won by five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> <unk> that at that height of the fire and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the dog was in the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house for the house of house where, as it was expected, his wealth got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the house of the house for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at for over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer <unk> I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people who have made it, or they are by doing remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have a little bit to give, it will be now.
We had food in a dining room, <unk> a park in the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules of a fixed view that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most widely building unit used in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things that we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He called it a brick of assembly itself.
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that they've been made over 400 billion or 75 bricks by every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuitry and more complex at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a colored code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one of the green one is producing light.
Can we put a button in the middle and have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light bulb.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have an noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower or slower and turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to take together bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, <unk> solar panels, everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a night light works or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to it.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience any in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
   A few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of <unk> <unk> who have no experience in engineering, just wooden and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> canyon in the movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of the dark.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the grasp of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is seeking to engaged in the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can better continue the video to one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I mean, this is the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to have a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that represents almost everything we're supposed to work with, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like about <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of preparing the Third World -- we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> to <unk>
When I was a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here appears as if I would look at a quote, but what really looks for is someone gets clean up when it gets caught up on the snow because it knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it be asking for aid to this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we would spend a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he made a good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component there.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 applications last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads viral.
A responsible system of <unk> city City, looking at this application realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
So he asks citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just got <unk> to make people become <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a natural and natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't normally matter.
<unk> acquisition takes a couple years old.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that they've done the normal channels that would have taken at least two and three million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the court of California that far two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shooting shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the best of the best ways to work -- not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can bring together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in view.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us nuts -- the government is, essentially, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone don't survive.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't accept the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> out of us -- remember that by <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is about everything about <unk>
This is the phone care center and information center.
It's the place that serves calls if you check it into the U.S.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
<unk> <unk> on the official knowledge database.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music very hard and see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has not a call center.
It has a web and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that application.
It was the work of very intelligent people in the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if she's dead.
How do I make it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the bucket cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to a volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological technology.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get up and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could have had them connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper as the neighbor is a better alternative, than the government services.
When one neighbor helps the other one, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think it's the entrance to the other.
What our entry to the government system is <unk>
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like a immense ocean, and politics is the <unk> <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is what keeps us that it belongs to us that we funded as something that is operating on our against our against the other thing, and we are losing power.
People think politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy <unk>
Because this is where the real government work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report from 325 pages in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism to <unk>
And for those of us who have benefited from the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go out where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everyone?
We can't do for government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to be able to root the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to come from, they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't care about making their voices.
They're using their hands.
They bring their hands to work to program a better job to work better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a trash cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have <unk> those fire hydrants and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government consumers and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone else, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also will be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that you say here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have in a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things -- if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in practice in practice my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> on our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and he looked at it, she was approaching me and I was a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I was going to come back, and if I said yes, I was left peace.
I had this human quality that would always make you wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all running my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at him and <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up across the room, and he took me out of the room, and he said, "Come on. We're both going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to you."
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that we always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you're always going to do the right thing while right now.
And I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do that."
And then finally he said, "I third that I want to tell me, is that we never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
I grew up in the field, in South <unk> I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14 or 15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package <unk> I don't know where the <unk> caught us to my sister and went to the forest.
We just got to make the <unk> of all the time.
He took a sip of beer, offered to my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You guys -- but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I don't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What is it? Take a <unk>
So I got the look at the force and <unk> <unk> you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that don't really make any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
<unk> 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, it finds so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black holes between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Florida, UMBC, Baltimore to 60 percent of all the young people who are in jail or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that comes to a lot better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what frames the results out.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these aren't problems with ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some of the good <unk>
In my state, in my state, as in other states, you fall out of rights as long as you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they had the law of the law to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was <unk> to 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country in jail for kids, without a chance to get out of.
Right now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They <unk> people on the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for wealthy crimes, but if we are <unk> kill.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and innocent and released from the death row.
A error, an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a sort of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're going to come up with <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of race and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we carry on with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth process and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people realized that we could not overcome segregation without a compromise with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what you would expect.
<unk> "We have no death row in Germany.
We're never going to be able to be it here."
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> we put people to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How are we going to focus on a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We could not take it off.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more engagement with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, <unk> those who never get to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so rational, so committed to the intellectual, as committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, with creativity -- development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also because of the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities as TED, must be <unk>
There is no <unk> related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from knowing about Rosa <unk>
These women were just getting together to speak.
Occasionally, I was called me to say, <unk> come up to me -- comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. <unk> went to me and said, "Now, I tell me it's that idea of justice <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed unfairly.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom hanging out with the kids.
We try to do something about death penalty <unk>
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of the end of me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And we were able to call it up very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got over, put me the finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated on simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't tell you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, certainly, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge by our technology, because of our design or rational.
At the end of the time, the character of a society is not because of the way they treat rich and powerful ones, but because of the way the poor, they sell them to prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I sometimes feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much strength.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> for adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn somebody into what is not it?
The judge as an adult, as an adult, I see a child.
One night I was very late at night was my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask about that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a tiny, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black customer from 14 years to be treated as a <unk> white <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there that there were been <unk> behavior on the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line, about how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, there was not only <unk> it was sent to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you. I said yes.
And so I approached it and <unk>
And I got involved in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the operating room.
And the judge the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> me."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those crazy things.
They have the cops <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how the room was full of people. All furious because we talked about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try to hear all that <unk>
I kept walking up here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the <unk> a <unk> showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood standing on the <unk> he looked at me and said, "Let's put this room of audiences to tell this young man who would keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come here today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is tied up with each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, for those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your way, do something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are multiple opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort to give them the funds that are spent today in science politics.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, a billion years.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases were not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity to change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to come up to make the law, to the security.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
<unk> growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence.
It's because of the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes of legal causes to bring people to the chain chain, by stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
I think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> Have you really excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be about the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means they prefer to describe negative news -- because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting many, many more data than probably the brain can be able to do.
And as nothing matters more to survive, the first stop all of this data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is the early warning <unk> the danger detector.
<unk> and recorded all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make no harm.
So of course, a <unk> of stories would look at the negative ones.
That old saying from the <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because of all digital devices give us negative news for the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is that we got <unk>
Perhaps progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the scarcity of species, water scarcity and <unk> no doubts what we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, just with them.
<unk> then in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita by inflation has <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity, and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we keep getting higher and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, <unk> television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the rubber century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It was a lot of this technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we would have on the technology of information jumps on this curve, Moore's Law -- and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason, your mobile phone is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft and bad time, in the war and peace, in recession, depression and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, and the ability to democratize and personalized production on all the planet, biology, synthetic biology, fuels and food, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory at the "Jeopardy" of Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I sought to the newspapers the best headline I had.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to opponents <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the nuances of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, which can positively affect the lives of a decade in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact life for a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have a absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that they've already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each <unk> <unk> it's about creating a life of how possible.
It's about taking that one that is very good and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops from <unk> ate with silver, and the same <unk> covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington <unk> tip in Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal, of <unk>
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made it so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It <unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about the energy shortage.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about season, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to 15 cents from national average.
And if we have plenty of energy, we have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars right now.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan has pointed the Voyager spacecraft Voyager into the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, water is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> water on the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology that's available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes to nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's capable of generating a thousand liters of water to the day of any source of <unk> saltwater, water <unk> by less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that it will make a major test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this is going to be, Coca-Cola is going to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the end world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton does 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have imagined before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, images, libraries of books and music, technology and diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to me when the applications come in.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> you can get blood out of the finger.
You have to make better diagnoses than a successful medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there's <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that won't be able to call the health <unk> and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we're going to go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before they add up to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you do? What wishes to <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the biggest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health -- thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy with the Khan Academy -- and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three dollars?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X <unk> is that small teams of his passion with a goal of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing about medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with these college teachers, among others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people came together, and they started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, that gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion of them new minds that we were going to join us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have an extraordinary few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that there was <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk> of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, on the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what's going on here?
Second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about mangroves.
There were <unk> from about 20 inch, the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and was going on for a good moment, so it was made more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
<unk> at five centimeters tall.
They put a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> -- the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty cool, called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and, above all, in the Southern Sea.
So what we capture was something called <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny spots on each other, the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom goes from being a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We had once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what they collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
I would put the place to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it, this is something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have some <unk> biodiversity, lots of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation of using images will use the beginning of their conscious life as normal and it extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the succession of changes.
And at the end of the end, it was <unk>
And that, in great measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals around it.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
We focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because they <unk>
There are few fish, but we thought that is the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because evidence presented in an earlier way is not in the way they would expect that to have evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of these things like that is Captain such and just watched a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally use the use of fish scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be a protected area.
Because with marine areas we really recreated the past.
They have spent the past that people can't conceive of it, because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine protected zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the West -- for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Area.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were <unk> with the movie <unk> I talk about the story of <unk> why do we play with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> to make it <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and what important that is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done with the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours of video on YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of percentage is wrong, gets lots and lots of views and makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of conventional summer.
<unk> didn't talk to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this guy who was <unk> the video to the <unk>
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> presented us and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start a Friday.   You all want to get on the end of a week, last weekend.      I read Friday. I would go on a Friday.  KA: Wouldn't it be thinking that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took a <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or an creators group will take a point of view, and they share with a more broad audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great inner joke then starts to talk about that and make things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation consistent with a beautiful music.
That's it, that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours of three hours that has been seen four million times.
As far as cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet Internet community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old one.
And then it became successful.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen would happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all become <unk>
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk>
What do you script could have been written by this situation?"
In a world where two days of video per minute, just that really only thing and unexpected can make sure that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy that protest against <unk> to cyclists in New York, I admit I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I'm <unk> by not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that are going to prevent you flowing properly through the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise of surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million watching and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we make in creative ways.
And all this leads to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of creative communities of participation, all totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't be asked permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just about the current media -- but we will have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> they face the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long, my friends, now <unk>
They become silent.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but I got it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girl.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task for their family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the <unk> sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were telling us, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady pace of the engine, <unk> diving into each <unk> and on the horizon vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to <unk> for six hours.
But I can remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and she died, and he died, and he died, was too much for it, and the first apple I tried for me was given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is four women across three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants with them.
Unlike the middle class <unk> whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English were traded to the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, would not matter what you should be <unk> who was usually <unk> clothes was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform up to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> went back to house."
At home, where?
Something to me is <unk>
He was <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were talking about our day and <unk> our grandmother's movements in the house.
My mother had to <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry <unk> and <unk> and <unk> boys and were caught in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one -- I was the classic <unk> student -- what I was talking about myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives and <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of mine, I was elected the young Australian year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges, not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that had never heard of, and in houses she would never have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single one and running <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got into the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more I was talking, the more I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths in life, many of them doing what we were doing on the border of the possible.
And even though I finished my birthday, I realized I couldn't stay in a career of <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly <unk> new one, and not only is it right, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a ship of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean by <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> didn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was a power there, a optimism <unk> a rare optimism of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would take a little group of people for the people who the motto cannot be <unk> was an alternative challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was making a giant soup.
<unk> up till entrance to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright, and we opened up.
It made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
By 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, it caused a <unk> to the <unk> and it took the cause of it, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't be <unk>
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and watched it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around the <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
On the night a monk. He said he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You've got no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since those of us who were and how life we built up, we can now see that the men that had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave at each <unk> the <unk> rate of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and watch a secure thing, you would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and pick up the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior <unk> I was <unk> I was holding a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The bottom line was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And I was very excited about that.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to be <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my <unk> thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them that they get.
We put our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I told me to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic.
I was talking about books for the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how to take the book.
Where we are.
And put up the text with the image, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I become a character from the book.
At a number of times, I get an iPad -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic of childhood -- to those ideas that we <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar I always turned on to me.
So over here, we have to put the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light your way out of what owns the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was a <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a <unk> that I would go into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In any fantasy textbook there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes down, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content, and in contemporary time.
These are the <unk> here.
We all have heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a regular child history.
In a story that is about current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> glued to their <unk> they haven't left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a little girl, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to restore this childhood ritual to come out and, in a chapter, we would take a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a new digital collection of pictures that can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the different variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and on it on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons show up on the inner plants of the house.
So at a moment, the screen is full of leaves behind.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology to get closer to another.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and us themselves to the natural world and that magic joy and child love that I felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we fix it?
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my phone. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I was sending out my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is -- not at the same time when I need <unk> or some urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi <unk> and before I took up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take them from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they would take their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back and reclaim the control and be ship from their own <unk> but it can also help us care about the health challenges because of the challenges we face, how the firing of attention cost <unk> the demand for demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video here.
All of us have controls navigation in <unk>
Maybe we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food chains of food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we ask the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in a <unk> office and you are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone for Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish we wanted to <unk>
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you go on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
Also I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
It could be services or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used to use the camera the process was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a very <unk> road in a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to have been captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we can catch a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real?
Is it the details or the <unk>
Would you raise light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive them on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way can create something that is still <unk> as if that was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
These are actually in combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those ones that don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But in combining photographs it's very important to do, because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photographs should have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images have been taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of different images with a perfect hole.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
Here's another example.
You might think this is a picture of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that would find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find out to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made red the top of the top of the island to make it more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic outcome I think you need to be planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and you can really realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start by showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
So if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one I took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if I draw them on a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to give you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you were to take a little bit of another technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change <unk>
If the technology of <unk> transport technology as quickly as the past <unk> we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented story in the history of technological development -- that every few years advance by magnitude.
The question I want to pose is to look at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't stay forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
We did one of two things.
Or it will turn into a typical curve, I know like this until it comes out something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe it will happen something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
What new world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
So a transformation. Can we feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we looked at each billion years.
So you go back and two billion years ago when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are going on around them.
If you look at the way that these chemicals are organized we give us an idea of how things came from.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there were some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes in its inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so they grew up.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms these oil <unk>
But those droplets of them weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription from chemicals.
And every time you become <unk> they will be <unk> of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every drop it was a little different.
In fact, the drops that in fact, is being better at an hour to incorporate chemical chemicals into it, they grew more, <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple chemistry, but things are going to be interesting when these droplets learned the <unk> trick.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to store information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without any sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to figure out what they were.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since we've evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living will be expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide people's security <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and you would rotate it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I've got a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If you were a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
And the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy about a billion years.
But then another big step in the way things were going to get very different in the things that things got very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are so many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in some ways, they were together on it, and established a <unk>
In that way <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were increasingly <unk> and they were rewarded for evolution.
And the turning point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have <unk> communities, communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or your muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
So these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not doing more than process information in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that these cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and conveying information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruits because I knew evil and sick at the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism that before they had built these structures of information processing structures that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit yet.
And so the fact that the nervous system built those information structures is hugely <unk> the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the communications trick.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here sitting here in some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated and turn it into sound, into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
Now we go through periods of periods for organisms to <unk> <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the video tape, the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you about they took a billion years each.
The next few phases and the brain took a few hundred million years.
The next decade and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, it looks like a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life to design computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent stories.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor is doing in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that you can't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, it's the evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process operating on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, run all these programs, and take those things that are more excited about what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say that I want to tidy numbers, to put a simple example.
And so we find the programs that are closer to figuring out numbers.
Of course, you are unlikely to be a few random random sequences of instructions, so none of them did it.
But one, fortunately he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now <unk> the ones that we better find out the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that your children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
It takes a few mutations to do.
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, these are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to figure out how they work.
These are dark programs.
But do you have the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing it.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer an <unk> flight, don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering is.
However, we don't understand the whole choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much faster quickly.
I mean, it was <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms.
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our part of thinking that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating what it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I deal with my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have the know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> would take three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is <unk> to the first base, not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> of 10.
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> <unk> in a regular <unk>
Now I'm going to look at this to my world in medicine where I feel much more <unk> or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you about today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they are tortured to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place, and a wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor comes down to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 percent.
But do you know something?
She's getting better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think should be the average of a <unk> heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
So 1,000, pretty well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon.
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would be included by being perfect.
That never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I did when I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> on the General <unk> <unk> at Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent diagnostic diagnosis and the standard.
And I even knew the actual diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you look at everything, then you would know everything, or as possible as possible, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought to the emergency lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At that moment I was assigned to <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And to report the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what I gave up a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of pump blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are <unk> blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave it to <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would see, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that was constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inside that would say, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that he was asking for the lunch lady -- "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought about and then he said to complete <unk> "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the high school, and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went down to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something that I did not normally do normally, at that time.
It went to the emergency service on the emergency service home.
And there another nurse, not the one that I was talking about the old lady before, but another one, he said to me three words, those three words that most physicians of emergency emergency doctor.
Other specialists fear people too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember you?
"It remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And I said, "Well, she <unk> the same word <unk>
She was fine.
But I went back and went back to the edge of death.
As an hour of having come to her home, after I gave her the high school, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> they brought them to emergency room with a blood pressure by 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock of loss.
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff would <unk> all their resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and waiting for all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later it was clear that we never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they were shocked to see what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names they die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was excited about that, and I experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt yourself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford to do with your colleagues.
You make our peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> shame I'm talking about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was bad, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I <unk> the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent to her home?
And in my worst <unk> why made a mistake so <unk>
Why I chose to choose medicine?
Shortly to a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, it opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you were to raise the efforts to be perfect for no more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It went back to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He was <unk> and he sent him home.
But as he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my <unk> change my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And he made three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw by pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I had no <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can <unk> on Google. It's an infection, not because it's an infection, but the top area, and that can cause the close side of those tracks.
He wasn't dead.
You can get antibiotics and antibiotics and recovered recovered at a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
It was an X-ray <unk> but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking out the patient perceived to be some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, and he called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I would read it.
And I went through it, and to notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on, and they recovered well.
But every single case I was passionate about -- I was shocked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't tell you and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about a failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a listening party to talk about the errors of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have a time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that they don't sleep and the ones that you know, ones who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you go from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay safe.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a bad medical study for medical <unk> and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the Hebrew Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infections are increasingly and more <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
In this country, 24,000 <unk> are dying by <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Institute in America established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A self-organizing system -- where knowledge is divided every two or three years, and we don't tell us.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with <unk> and suddenly, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't have their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we eliminate all the professionals -- well, it's not going to get anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their wildest cases.
In my <unk> <unk> white art, is already a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> this is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students had <unk> <unk> their head and checking saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> <unk> is human, and they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn how to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving and loving way.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, <unk> errors mistakes.
And I feel so much but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says picking a half a half a half a day.
Not long ago in a research followed by a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded all different tasks by these executives and time that we were making decisions.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works a week.
So naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we figure out how they manage those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing in the overload of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There was 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but one occasion I asked myself, why would I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> which came out of trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and I asked him to do well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed at me full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
I would put a place for <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 tastes different and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> a <unk> that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What stopped when he was 24, only three percent had been able to buy <unk>
And so they stood up when six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> us less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the day of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans between a few 650 plans in the country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds are available for savings plans for retirement savings savings savings savings savings savings plans for people to save for the future.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of <unk> had less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of involvement passed to the <unk> 60.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of options, more people are being transferred to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as we had more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are going to agree to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, even when this goes against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health care.
They are more likely to pick up things less <unk> even though objectively it was better.
The main reason is that we're going to be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've got, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test them in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard about it before, but it's never been more than today, which is less than today.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you choose to cut, get rid of odd <unk> choices -- there will be an increase on sales, you will have a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> just eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> bigger sales and lower cost.
You know that the supermarkets today are offered 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, you get some 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato type.
In the financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage better choices is the <unk> David <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a insurance pool of life.
Those who are really willing to choose, give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences we have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't afford to do their <unk> either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on a vacation of vacation with all the most beautiful road on the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want the <unk>
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to get it, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who is ready to accept it.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit you to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second -- but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the overload <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and the consequences must feel very very specific <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use credit cards or credit that when you use it to use it?
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting, which was exactly the way we were doing, we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we appeal to the staff who would think of the positive things that they would make in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts of <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can manage more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a collection of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarket <unk> along the <unk> <unk> the magazine show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because rating tells me how to fix it.
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating framework is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to you who are <unk> not to the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge lists of funds.
I suspect who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than what we think of, if only a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity of it.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision to do it, you buy it a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that enables <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is they will vary the order of the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, a few times four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to say?
What about you are.
If you <unk> always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We find that the ones that go from a lot of choices to time, they would take the default button over and over again, and another more.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, same data number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick up the box of change that doesn't say anything about the preferences of the interior <unk> in all ways that you make a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> to get rid of alternatives -- <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories at less than <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help you manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for people who work to work.
I think the key thing to get the best of a choice is to be careful about the <unk>
And the more careful that we're going to be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that had a typewriter should be written by the government.
I had to record a piece of text from example of the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint down to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would lead to the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that is going to end up having some bright print print on every page that follows a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the worries for a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by flying banks to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret secret in the U.S. secret two months ago, I was looking at the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be the victim of a <unk> that is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of <unk> in the importance of <unk> today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, motivate them the protests, motivate them to motivate them to motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a massive role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national states, governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> authority in the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week, I asked him at a meeting with the Dutch government representative to ask one of the leaders if he <unk> <unk> the death of people to cause the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die because of a heart attack.
<unk> is an Australian authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- services like <unk>
Except that we have a foreign <unk> authority, except for it.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt, the <unk> secret police headquarters in April, 2011, and during the <unk> <unk> they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government and <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments give them tools for governments to protect them to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
We have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy versus safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right you will have today will be forever.
Would you get to any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south part of Park.
These are cows in my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences in the largest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon as we were growing up in the morning and found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions was scared of fear.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because I was even helping lions see the pen away.
I don't know <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came to the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were left, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I went down and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come out.
And I discovered that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn on and turn out the lights.
And this is a little broken <unk>
They get everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights go.
As you can see, the <unk> are <unk> out of where the lions.
And that's how lions look at when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so that I think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to having trouble with lions.
And the housing houses had the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see them. You can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to scare other predators like Johns <unk> and it's also being used to laugh elephants of farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to fix it.
So a year ago, it was just a child in the meadows of the savanna the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and told me that someday I would be inside one.
Here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical leaders.
What is the next to your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close to you -- CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you were already invented <unk> but I want to do the mine.
CA: So I will do it for a time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We are going to take them on every step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk> anything."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we will spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
So what he said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms watching his mother's face without able to do anything.
No one would blame them because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine equivalent to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy footprint, all of me was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, allowing North America.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I went to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is like a refugee refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the refugees North America were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to an awful destiny of the North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the rest, an officer said to another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America were looking for asylum in the Algerian node.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although they had been able to have been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and finding work, all of their world can make it in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to put a <unk> going to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different from <unk> <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call pride in my hair.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The U.N. North Korean authority were given some money that sent my family, and as honored my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside of the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning out how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked them to all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border C.O.s in <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the embassy in South Korea.
I was going and came out between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I was explaining to him the situation, and without <unk> the man was on the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and the other two North Koreans, and take them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to be able to get more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and support from international community are really the <unk> of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language language, and more of the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us are following in contact with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to flourish with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, let's change the name of the South Center for which it represents something else, so they changed the South L.A. as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> food, <unk>
Like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home to the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring more people to kill more people in the car.
People are dying of heart disease, in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I emphasize that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of the house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> chairs and sold as self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of running 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 of me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me at wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we put us together and we start planting our forest forest forest <unk> you know, the nine full vegetables in it.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group of <unk> made up by gardeners of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone will <unk>
The city <unk> me on top of me and I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my yard, and the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on it, right?
A gun order for planting food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk> land.
It's 68 miles from <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth does it do well this?
<unk> a plant -- 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there. I got my kids there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what land can be done, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became a tool of education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It will be used to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, that a mother and his daughter were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I am not afraid you're going to go <unk>
It's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to make her <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed the changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, as about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all on a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you are stuck. I see kids that are on this way that they are designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see a chance in which we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because the free thing is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to stop working on people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy and pride and honor to grow their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, well, if you want to meet me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some crap to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with his <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace <unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road here.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in a days like today, that it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
In addition, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, we want to close to the cities, we want a road to quiet around.
The solution for that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has has pores and water can go through it, so all the water of rain flow up the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollowed out, all of the noise you disappear, so it's a very silent road here.
It also has some disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the stones on the surface are <unk>
First, a stone, then several more and more and more, and then -- and then -- well, I'll not do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
They can sometimes create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt -- like I said, so you just have a little bit of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they'll be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So, if you're driving around the road, you will get the <unk> you can see it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use steel <unk> from that for clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very little pieces, and we can mix these little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk> in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to give you a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the rocks will spread through the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to go to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We need to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the <unk> test, and then, of course, this road last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we try them in the lab.
We made a lot of samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then we put it up with our <unk> machine and <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the road, even they can even double the life on the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
It really has to cool first before I can show you how the repair works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to me in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile on her face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got out of Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister -- who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could do it as well.
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books on market bags to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us who were in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school was approaching suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you live."
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that her daughter, my mother, my mother was to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the risk <unk>
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate her children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated about our life, and I was always scared and I couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can tell you your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate at <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage of educate his daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college title, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I'm driving over the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I go in a big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the way in front of an opposition.
As a <unk> is not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get home, you're the phone, a voice <unk> that if he was still sending her daughter to school, they would try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I didn't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I have to realize from Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of us who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and what it sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear these changes would not last long, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who are <unk> for them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since that was the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the border of the regime, each of the regime, <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a copy of copy of the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses of about 50,000 dead and we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved together a lot of other women, rebuild the civil society -- <unk> and just to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to it.
They set up about 200 organizations in <unk> for, and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of <unk> <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about developing capacities and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> for <unk> -- a very supportive orientation leaders, to advocate for the connective autonomy of the woman and for our right of the <unk> of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
And over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, shortly by little, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
Another day we had the news from the murder of the U.S. and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news from the murder of military officials from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made up of a democratic mindset -- more and away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all for us today to <unk> with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
I'm here today to argue that we, as a nation, we chose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't have peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between the candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by the selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men as a women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus beyond what the election needed to do, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the female more than the <unk> representation of the <unk> and <unk>
We need to stop acting as an outrage of the outrage and call a days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not just <unk> but to put purpose in practice in practice, instead of <unk> and collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> in the war, desperately desperately needs to achieve peace.
Because peace has an <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between women's perspectives and the male <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions of the same root as the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that spans the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the villages have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows up inside, the divine matrix of compassion is all the existence.
And so you say, "My mercy is all things."
This is what you can tell us, "My mercy <unk> on my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which has an answer equally <unk>
This is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all make a good thing for why she's left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who would tell him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York City for my first work as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I would create my alma soul, invited me to head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap in love, where they fall every year and millions of women and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I am <unk> in English University and I have an MBA in <unk> from <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the <unk> list, <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been spending almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all the <unk> all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse is only men, and of the duration of the duration of the <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to sit with a man who sticks it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the age of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and <unk> husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York City and started to meet me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just <unk> from a college <unk> college and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most of the first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of <unk>
He did it about everything in the beginning of it in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me that I was so list, that I had gone to Harvard, I started passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the arts degree in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do any sacrifices to your partner, and so <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical <unk> financial and psychological and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where these weapons come in.
As soon as we moved to New England already you know, that place is supposed to be that they had to feel so sure she bought three weapons.
One had on the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept her under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that it needed these guns to cause the trauma that lived in a kid.
I needed them to feel safe.
But these guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never had my hand out of my hand, my life was very serious about danger, every minute on every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend from my mother and married him with him.
Despite what I had happened. I was sure that we were living happily forever, because I loved her, and he was also so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> by the wedding and the fact to form a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I was never <unk>
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so hard in the head that I would spend several times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon was thrown out by traffic and threw a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> kept taking one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
To go back to my question: Why is I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody is doing is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people make people, because we have the victims, we know something that you know, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has order to end the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to <unk> to the victim and their kids, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it's just not going?
I was able to go and I was able to go, because of one last <unk> he beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the police, to my neighbors and family and family and family, and I am here today because all of you will be <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines like headlines, and women are <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
And for some people is a way to say "The fault is it by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> intentionally <unk> from men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned hundreds of stories of what happened to them and that they would promote their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor, of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a male and kind of man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to be going back to -- you know, it's a <unk> gun to my head by somebody who says it wants.
So at this point, the same is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what dumb <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting their daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love to actually breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Silence is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply by shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the abuse of the light by talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and family and family.
They <unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> that have a future <unk>
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this point, there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have my eyes like that.  Luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first <unk> change on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of kind of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to take them now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> fewer than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would say to me that he was going to get her back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, safely with surgery or an artificial tan -- like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed for <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, shape of <unk> and white skin.
And that's my heritage heritage, -- heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of fashion that are <unk> <unk> There are <unk> Joan <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, we would take them for how much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> that is to say, less than four percent, they were not <unk>
The next question that people are always asking for me is to be a model when you're <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't care about that.
But then what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> I want to be a model, then I said, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> chief of the American American magazine, or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a <unk> and you have a paper and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you might want to be president of the United States, but you want to see the Model Model <unk> for 10 years, people would look like weird.
The next question that people always do is whether all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was going on, and I was also the first picture I was using a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
So here I am with my football team, and I am at L. magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> from a professional group of professionals, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is to do things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to keep <unk>
<unk> out of these privileges I think, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price on their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and Latino groups, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
It's how many times I <unk>
When I looked for this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes down to 78 percent at 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life in a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people and creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever get asked, with some more thin legs and the brighter hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a set of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the brighter hair and the <unk> clothes, but probably the most <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of oppression and gender and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that involved in this talk, I hope they're all more comfortable to recognize the power of the image of the image that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was more enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't go to me who <unk>
There was no directors, no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a small care of the lighting light.
In fact, most of them were taken out tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and the 5.
He took it back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has no ever <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a girl five years I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a October week, and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution throughout the years, not only at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, even though we have the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter, new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how he perceives and interact with everything.
That concrete time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, at one of the travel, we were walking. We were walking, when all of a sudden, he stopped in the dry and pointed out with a red <unk> of the <unk> shop with little personnel in the previous shoes.
And he described to me what made sense to five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart is <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't want to go close to somebody and asked, do you get out of a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs, as well as <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, laughter, <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that I associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> they don't help prevent the spread of disease.
They're far from <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There is the <unk> in the New World who are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the West <unk> the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face high risk of extinction.
So why are they going to be important -- first of all, they provide vital ecological services services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would not be because they would spread out and cause great losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> <unk> in places like <unk> -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason why they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey by livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned by using vet in India, and they've taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread on the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> it has a huge time bomb for <unk> -- the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel in different countries, so I can focus on a problem locally not going to serve at all.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can they help? It can become assets, to make noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them what we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures. We will spend their time to spread the word <unk> the word.
When you go out of this room, you tell them about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw it flying without effort, without energy spending on the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, all we played with you <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> south of India to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were amazed that the local -- in such fertile fertile -- had not been agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people from the country of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe -- we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, from the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> came out of the river and they ate all the --  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you have the <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought that only to us, Italians made mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what the French did, and then to see what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>    You can see the waste that we would give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I'm not telling you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat anybody in a different culture as if I was my children, you want to ask you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if it was my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The tiny thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for the age of just to respond to the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? Are you <unk>
It would never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can have success alone.
The person with the idea can not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for a time, <unk> them, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never will be in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So, the planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in your community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face and you have to create social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You should create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor who sets up with you in your home on your kitchen, in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to make a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this junk garbage where we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very difficult.
I <unk>    So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of death of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up to talk to you.
You have to offer you a privacy, you have to be fantastic to the patient, and then it will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about, you know, more than this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that an engineering spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the fossil revolution -- <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that was in a journal <unk> many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they got together this group of people, and I got this group of people who would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population gets growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States, <unk> generic companies <unk>
So the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In other ways, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the larger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked at and observed in the 100 companies icons of the <unk> world, <unk> Ford -- all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of them started by one person.
Never the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment of small business in <unk> in bars with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this <unk> who speaks to this <unk> someone who would ask you, What should it take?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it. You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't get a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects arose from questions like, how much are my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a <unk>
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for the local stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give a shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always supporting music --  -- there is a fashion in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest U.S. properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was suddenly sudden and unexpected
I thought about death and <unk>
And this made me deep gratitude for the living and the living time.
It gave the clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But let's go through my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to catch the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her sentences phrases to <unk> Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled with and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit in the <unk> of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before they die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die I want to give you one more."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope for people to laugh at me laughing <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in ways of new and <unk> -- it's about giving <unk> the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we are growing and we change it.
This happened last year and I started to receive hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now they've been made up walls of countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces, if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our growth era, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of conserving the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that to prepare for death is one of those things that make us more power.
And if you think about death that we lived our life.
Our shared spaces can actually reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more media to share hope and stories, the people that surrounds us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and <unk>
It doesn't talk, but it transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's sharing it <unk> it passes what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and notice this is never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say a word that I didn't even want to -- it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that has to be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
Do you get the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that I got every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, he pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
You don't think <unk>
But most people agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the <unk> concept of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual -- it plays in a different way of there that <unk> it's so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause and cure <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new way in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that would be <unk>
As I was growing up, it got more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent one, a child who saw the world without biases, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change at normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have, are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and frankly, the search for normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who gave a kind of communication to engineering.
I was scared.  And I was really afraid.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I surprised them the ideas they had, and I wanted other to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key thing to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care environment among others, and if we don't know what we don't understand about this, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please bring them together with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that his engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply studying the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make some dumb ones.
Instead, as Einstein said, everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways of hook and interacting with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> <unk> kill and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's already supported by too much in the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then I will provide graphs that we would bring our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help the door to open the door and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words all over the Oxford English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a 19th century editor that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge no matter or a platform, and that, when he wins, he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allow newspapers to quote the exact words that were said to the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by the Parliament.
He got him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and at the end he had such the popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, the leader.
Didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American People in the U.S.
Not very much.
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven to go.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King of a fixed term.
And there could be <unk>
The whole world got tired of them together, because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it an Lion for if he did it or his designated ideas.
So, they wanted to give it the most <unk> plus insignificant <unk> and the most unfortunate title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it just meant <unk> that we would have a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were disappeared presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate got <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would be serious about a <unk> title as <unk> President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of argument the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite until I was able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you is that the title of President of America does not sound as modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story have gotten to the title of <unk>
So at the end he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looked like, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the five nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody will be feeling <unk> when you tell them that it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually changes a lot more changes the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and <unk>
Like others -- I have a cheap flashlight of light <unk> tied to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter per hundred feet on the ground.
He was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> who lost control and dropped <unk> <unk> in that hole.
While I talk to you today, these guys are in the deep time of that hole in the hole, and their lives without paying a reward and often, dying.
And I went home from that hole and went home, but they may never do, because they're prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in over 70 countries and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which has to do to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not as much grade.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very sad, I was honestly trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got choked up, my stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, we <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says there's now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much African African people throughout the entire slave slave together.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker
The equivalent of <unk> current <unk>
However, you can afford entire families for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to figure out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and they can't escape.
The slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those of the people produce them are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the <unk> <unk>
This weird <unk> show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees Celsius -- men, women, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy brick of <unk> mixed <unk> <unk> bricks in your heads until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> furnaces that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, making this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no bottles to eat, and no to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with conditioning to get rid of it, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera is getting a lot better treatment than these people.
Back on the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side and he was very quickly grabbed me, and he said, <unk> don't <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen from that country.
It could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system by his liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks for miles over <unk> until trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who took them and the children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made from <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they're working 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing with how they <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had totally their homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness to me, it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It led me by a few steps that gave this dirty basement of <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local for prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the middle of the <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they were going.
There was no windows.
There was no windows big enough to get it up.
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a subject that's so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, <unk> in the home service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex trade.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that we often relate to labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families in the silk of silk trade.
This is a portrait of family.
The black hands of black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and diving silk into the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope that we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> the biggest artificial lake in the world.
When we come, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two great brothers, a few older children, some young children make sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families and <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> on these boats in the lake, even though they didn't know swimming.
This child has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of branches of trees immersed in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, they're being thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
Because of the fear of his love is not going to run and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they go through the last networks, but they had been working from the one one.
<unk> <unk>
And I'd point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
<unk> lies as possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a partner, <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to take it on a land road to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started to go down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour found out that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos on my head as I went to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit into a soccer field, and everyone was full of enslaved.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and, as they were looking for gold, they were going to go in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
So wells you have to 90 feet and these people carry on their stone bags and then they'll be shipped back to another area where they were putting the stone to power the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin -- we see to work at the top of the others and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died her uncle took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> I did the debt of the uncle who will be a slave in mines.
When I met him, she had worked in 14 years and the injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and nevertheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream of being liberated and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and we will do everything that will help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see ourselves some other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from people, but real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I think I don't think of these many beautiful <unk> beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images show a force where you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turned into a fire and that <unk> light on the slavery -- because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematics applied and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management jobs.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of more human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time was a ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet ballet dancer,
In the last few years, it has been a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement of the movement there is no biological markers, so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they have never been done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey to the clinic. What if patients could get the exam to do the test themselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to do is <unk> as a conventional way to try to, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it makes sounds like a vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
You can see a <unk> example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
He shake <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do these tests look at the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they both <unk>
The neurological test isn't <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are accurate. Well, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're very minimal and all of us know what happens next.
When something takes a cost that's so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals for <unk>
We can reduce the patient <unk>
I would not need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
We could often get objective data.
We could make a <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk>
Along to <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's disease, you can call it low price and take a recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call -- you have to indicate if you have or not the <unk> disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not be able to do it. You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very large cross-section of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: They have a <unk> precision at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done fantastic work and now has shown now that it works on the mobile phone network too, what we would look at the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We would stay in the dark, in their own windows and, usually, we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin <unk> models still even more <unk> the perfect skin that we can do, and we can engage in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where it was <unk> there were to be <unk> in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small town of fishermen located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded it reached over 24 feet tall and more than three miles, land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We have rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the slime off, and we left the house ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory car.
We got rid of us, and we loved it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
And we would take them to different places of the villages around them for <unk>
It wasn't until so that I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While I was fleeing the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean toilets -- gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be a place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard about the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, and I couldn't help in thinking how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all of them.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to get <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they were lucky more photos and got more <unk> so it was that we entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a neighbor town north of <unk>
Once in the week we use our scanner in the libraries of temporary libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that we have in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> an hour. I could do a weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using a guide the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these <unk> photos in water covered in <unk> covered with seaweed, even by oil, all this together with the time time I continue to focus on -- so <unk> on it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guide of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures already <unk>
As once he said that, the leader of my group is like to do a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky enough to the photos.
He had started to <unk> her same but he stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to put the images in a single photo and put the whole picture.
When they picked up their pictures shared some of their history with us.
A lot of colleagues in his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble so far away from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his son was under the age of 14.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could go back to look, something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been marked by that day in March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up with a few hundred of them helped us clean up to <unk> photographs -- the big <unk> -- most of them became the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families -- hundreds of pictures completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than <unk> in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a picture of someone or something, a place, someone loved somebody else.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take to look for.
This was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it's actually a huge difference in the life of the person who are getting in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something larger to bring something, using their talent to something that are not a thin brain of perfect skin.
So to finish I'd like to read this email. I sent him repeat the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, <unk> around a baby, I was struck by a baby -- because a very similar picture of my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few our basic needs, it is the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet coming through an apple on an apple in a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a billion but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can create a slow motion of light into motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and put it on a <unk> second, or so, in various <unk> to create a package of photons just a millimeter away.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet is.
If we take that bullet and this set of photons and shoot it in this bottle, how are those photons inside this <unk>
What is the thing about the light <unk>
Now, all this --   I mean, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
So Coca-Cola doesn't take this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into a bottle of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table, and because of the insights on the top you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it go down the same distance and we see it slow down to about 10 billion times, how much you think that would take us to look at that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring movie.   of a slow <unk>
And what about to try with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are attached to the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the same time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of current.
But if you look at more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light sits down.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in the <unk>
As the photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> picture, you get very little light up.
But we will go to a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so just to get into some light.
They <unk> that <unk> that <unk> package -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very large <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, <unk>
And if a new power of the future would let him see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
The left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera itself, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point corresponds to where a distance.
When you project a laser project you can record a picture of <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we're going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what's going on at the curve, to the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light up the open windows.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the inside of the body -- <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood -- this is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> <unk> to solve the problems of imagining healthcare in the next generation.
So <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, he turned science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data we collect every time are not just for scientific patterns, but we can see that we can see.
And create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and code of color code.
Let's look at those waves that the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> of a second.
But this is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects  Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes comes up with the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime crime in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you can get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that we were looking for a change, had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who today have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Put your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a <unk>
It's a lot of a cell phone.
But today to talk about my mobile, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider have to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends it a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored at at least six months, and until two years, in their phone company or his <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone service and the Internet providers, and the Internet Internet <unk>
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who in that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all blah, <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to make a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, I got a deal.
And they would send me the demand and send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly picture of brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and 5,000 <unk> 30 lines of information.
I saw the first and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom up and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we ended up with this big communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were leaders, this would never happen.
The fall of the Wall of Berlin might never have happened.
And as a result, neither about the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, today's agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to her friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and it is not <unk>
So when you go home, you go home to her representative that just because business agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store your <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to give them to remind you that they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what's going on?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk> and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one had a <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, but they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- I don't want any of you to have any of them.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled as a disabled moment.
Come for me.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping mall, drive into circles for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit.
In addition, I have to tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There will be a gold <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I am Palestinian <unk> and woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from "Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood, and my disease had the same first time.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters, I got older <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters, older people went to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of the school system, and if I didn't <unk> all the ultimate note -- I would all have the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another tactic that I used to do was take a dollar in front of me for me to get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten just walked like a <unk> champion, which has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 and they're still in the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up there was no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat enough fat to live three months without eating it, so we finished the dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance to <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friendships were going to go through the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we got into <unk>
On my summer holidays often my father was about <unk> so I was drinking milk in my back, and I was drinking cups in the back, I was stuck in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> who could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And I can now focus on the head.
My parents would tell this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because I was going into all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart tasks I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "In the end of the <unk>
I have learned <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying crying -- historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, asking for why and she told me that because they believed I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the venture stunts you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that was literally born and gave it to an actress without cerebral palsy,
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled paper.
When I got home, I went home, and my first <unk> <unk> was kind of an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors are not white, with disability.
They just give up perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, he took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian he led to when he fell into the realization that I was going high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral palsy,
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news show on the wire with Keith <unk>
I walked in as if I went to graduate school, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can I give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the winning desk to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but he was just like <unk> full-time and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and a little girl or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would watch clips in line with comments like, "Why do I <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> we are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown up with the media, I don't think we were <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive pictures, that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We probably need all the society to teach our children.
My laminated journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> the great state of New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugee kids -- a little bit of what my parents were passionate about.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities -- there are no work, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day she gives him a guy who gives it to <unk> him after dinner for dinner, and after dinner, he took it.
It was a <unk> dynamic to people who give him a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send your family home.
They show a young man.
He finally ran home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy that small people with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a connected terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And its story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city is the great dream of the city is the opportunity of labor, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't afford to opportunities, the history of the <unk> the door door to terrorism, to violence, to be the history of multinational cities.
And in my city of birth, they <unk> 70 percent of the young people who are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor youth leaders at a business basis?
It was going to come to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat there and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunity.
And I remember when he was a graduate college college, because it was a college graduate college and frustrated, was the perfect white thing for Al <unk> and other minority <unk> to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get at the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool to the <unk> of <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was reluctant to train some of the young people at the summit of the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk> <unk>
For those of you who grew up in civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company from <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the young families, the young men can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a business of corporate spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> in development and set up their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, and they need the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and to create real <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is more than start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
And in <unk> <unk> that's how it's called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to make young people in entrepreneurs, to <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks and <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> mountains, an area <unk> north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was going to make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it's not going to be the way that we could <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> Lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of paper, <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed me, and I was getting a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where we <unk> the <unk> who cleans our trash <unk>
Who cleans our crap in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and the reason for 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of waste <unk> every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go to more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I wasn't just going to travel in the trucks.
And they <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe it, and in the days where it's very strong you will become quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> weight to carry on their body tons of junk all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Bureau <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and moving into traffic all day and they pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is particularly ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important hand, in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first boundaries of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and effective form every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent in real ways.
For decades that we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old <unk> we don't have space for what the engines of economics begin to fail when it's in harm's way.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed necessary.
I mean by just at the speed that we used to be used by moving at the time <unk>
We don't have to tell us, or we cleaned up or take a cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our bottle of water.
We use them, we forget them, because we know there is a job of work on the other side that was going to take away from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that maybe help to reduce stigma and engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street, every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to look at it?
And his work allows us to do our own ours.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that they keep left safely from ourselves from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always be held in one way or another.
One day after the September September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck in the street, he grabbed my little kid a little bit, and I went down the stairs and he went stairs and there was a man doing his journey from recycled as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and he said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate waste collection and went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we got good friends.
I want to believe that it was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species, we have to include and keep all the costs, even the very real human cost.
<unk> waste that we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage -- you know, a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects to this one of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives will become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in the capital of Health Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
Early on, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the cladding itself generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the entire year.
And third, its looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the open air, where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a building in the building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a very much growth zone of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries in the building.
And this extends with an <unk> <unk> who creates a space in the open air in the building that would be <unk> by its own form, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building.
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and it helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what you get.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the bank that there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it didn't have to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings on the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy power for the building in a city where electricity was cut down almost every day.
So we get a huge advantage putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with <unk> areas and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest thing I ever have designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I set special attention to the <unk> a thousand years earlier that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of <unk> access for pretty much straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the existing streets, creating 12 early initial blocks like the size and features that in Barcelona and other cities with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select a few points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's take a scheme to claim that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost as a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then on the lower plant we have all the connections for the pedestrians.
And also answers to local norms that set up a greater density on higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving away the community in the building room for construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can upload and <unk> and make activity such as running a two kilometers in the morning, or jumping from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that our buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective connecting nature to people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a small <unk> of pencils that was super strong for the state capitals very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the way out of school. I was a little afternoon and I stood in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then, I did.
I would take television ratings just a little bit, just a little bit.
All the way --  And I set me back to the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows from <unk> and myself a row of that, just because of being there, because I got there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all obvious <unk>
I never got <unk>
But above all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered by that little girl so small, it was so good at <unk>
I will love jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. The tiles are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab where we study <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no King <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and we had <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, I almost have all of them.
This year you spend 100 years of their masterpiece, "In <unk> <unk> the most compelling study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> and the ordinary <unk> all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is that image.
We forgot how <unk> it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know what the cat looks like, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to person, their wish, for their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being around and storytellers and audience, we know exactly what the details were going to put out the knife -- right?
<unk> do all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure in the other, maybe myself."
And it's starting to be said to itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every genuine <unk> senses in his lover, it adds it to his collection of instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion of it. You need to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> get rid of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like big amounts of hair, bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> <unk> of soon listening behind the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, a truth for the truth, one really painful truth -- in fact, what we were to <unk> <unk> the more agonizing the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who says, "A woman who makes us suffer, that makes us suffer, it causes a lot more profound and vital feelings than a wise man can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Do you have any other emotion that teaches us to look at that <unk>
Freud would write about it later.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young man who was used with the idea that his woman would read it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or would not be <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
novels are really good at this.
novels really describe how the <unk> are doing very well as <unk> but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we actually became residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan was <unk> was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from the one that was sent to deliver messages <unk> awful for a year.
For one year. Every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to use the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to be <unk> and <unk> from what ever <unk> and he's under the floor -- <unk> your name, takes your <unk> cow <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as well as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
novels show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not safe when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the curse at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had a <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of a rat of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs to <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we would get it up and put it up with <unk> on each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with its solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It looks like this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It looks like treating them as a geometry, a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a <unk> minute is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> you can admire that idea of being he <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a matter where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is using jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the sea of <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest taxpayers in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave up to about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 people, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the <unk> crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on his surface, which he Aldrin held after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and fragility in our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had a better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F.
Why turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why will you scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why will you fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's evolution.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
During the most part of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a <unk> ship, but in 1969, the <unk> crew <unk> 10 flew 40,000 miles / hour.
From the 1970s, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> crew <unk> and the optimism bias about the power of technology has evaporated has evaporated in the power of technology has evaporated to go to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or to feed the world population seem to have a result.
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the escape escape tube from the rocket.
I knew very much that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure I'd come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that occurred to us with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like if the technologists would be distracted by us and enriched them with a trivial toys -- things like <unk> and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> at Intel -- Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically, incentives that venture venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the investment investment caused by creation of ideas -- by the funding of <unk> problems or even false trouble.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what is wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, more small investment, investment that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had a problem to invest with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and development that are in the long term. They have not invested in the development of technologies that are dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a very immediate <unk>
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we do not solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of energy that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, technologists, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and treated international energy development development, a significant increase in the research and development development and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate where we will see an energy policy in America, or the international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technology, they are not going to be.
We know for time that famines are result of the failure of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or grow systems for the storage and food feed, but there will be famines as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes make a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The president Nixon gave him the cancer of the cancer in 1971, but we found out that there are many kinds of cancer, some extremely resilient cancer types, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need to do it, but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it should be really a problem with the problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there's no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction as the way of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that they are missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the <unk> ideas that you have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread statement.
The second is a goal: to have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should be <unk>
I think the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has been <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities, or institutions that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people that are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep inspiring the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they're still quite <unk> they have nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half to the road.
But is this evidence for enough?
What television polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at is the attitudes that people appear when you ask some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I'm probably going to be asking, "What do you want to do what?"
And that would be a very controversial answer.
And you could say, when you've said your question, "Well, I trust the question, but in other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence in a <unk>
We don't assume the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person, and it's going to be uniform in all these cases.
I could, for example, I have to say I trust a certain grade teacher that I know to give you the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to attract good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a broken goal.
It's not that the goal that I would <unk>
I want to get more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with a very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> that is the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yes, OK, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how bad people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and <unk> then we'll have a very good reason for trust in it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, in the contrary, they're not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the post, because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would make their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If so, I don't have any <unk>
But that's what we're going to get up with before you are.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's difficult.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build accountability for all kinds of institutions, professionals, and people and so forth, that make us make us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, let's ask the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that would go to <unk>
And we found the same problem in the whole of our public lives, and we can find that the <unk> system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is making the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You know, you know, you all know the similar examples.
It was all that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you are going to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that are trustworthy and whether we are able to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
You know, <unk> the task of <unk> puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately, it's kind of signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, generally all the time.
But you also have to give you a chance to find out that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That is a day every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> -- very effectively.
Let me give you a single commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without giving explanations out.
I wear it and return me the money, or they change the color that I want.
That's great, I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're looking at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we have come up with us by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has become increasingly increasingly increasingly and more, at such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine what it would be.
So first I created this tool that would be focused on digital space, so that when the hard <unk> against the screen is their physical body to the <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How can you go inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of the hands?
In the Science of Science <unk> of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital <unk>
They <unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras depth to detect the fingers and their face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, to get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can look through the book, and you can see lines or <unk> or words with the virtual touch sensor that are down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In all of these examples, we were going to get in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information to us?
<unk> many of us shall buy and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of only seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physical as a way we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel here.
This imam <unk> it acts like a pixel in 3D in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, and what it means is that human movements can be able to go back to reproduce and go back in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically distance and the famous <unk> shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality of the time you want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and unlike monitors or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's most fascinating that will change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not only showing us something but starting to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us having to get rid of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, today but if we suppressed that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was inspired to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineering thing, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that there was only one path to the <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an singer from Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer should start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But any adult would give it the idea.
No adult got me serious.
I was just my friends <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
I thought for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved looking for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I would go to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were in China, of course.
<unk> Good <unk> about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda for <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird is weird.
That's one subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The meeting with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit of <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map was a map of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like a comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if reading comparative reading worked for research, why don't you do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> by Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For Christ, <unk> are social, politics and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized that Chinese Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I will not go back to feel like I was alone or <unk>
Having a broken dream is not really compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy to live again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch in my office and he took my shoes and told me she wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like first client.
And I was a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy just to move the head as I would <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw it, she was right.
You start to work after, you start home afterwards, she has kids later, until death goes on.
For those as Alex and I had plenty of time to be <unk>
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> led me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, coming out with guys underneath his category, it was <unk> with a <unk> head -- but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it gets closer to the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they would do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect time and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and it had real consequences -- not only for Alex and their loving life, and the lives and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one goes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> take away from sleep a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. Wow.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight percent of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give her life to life will have happened for when they have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and it is <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that wants to change yourself, it's now the moment to change themselves.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its endgame at 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to protect them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> adolescence of life.
journalists would say, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and does absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, really, really interesting as you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship will not be good at me, but I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My gosh, they're <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better study the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the play of chairs.
They were all running, and they went down, but then at some point around the 30, they turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of them started a career, choose a city, choosing a partner, and having two or three children in a period of much more short.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want right now.
You realize you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sit in the room, and I talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still can't decide, so that I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, it was living with a boyfriend, who showed more likely that ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult way, his previous life had been even harder.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she was getting up, she would say, "You don't choose his family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head over his legs and cried for almost all the hour.
I had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with her many contacts, but then he was watching empty space that follows after the words said, "In case <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give you a <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex in the way to just sit down as the decade <unk> on Emma would happen.
So, for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma which is <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For identity, I mean making something that add value to her person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital creates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that <unk> that you want to try it out.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm going to find the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that I would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with a similar minds are limited to who you know what they know how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out of it almost always comes from outside their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak bond friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't work.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the form of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs that are created never <unk> then meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job at all.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as it was <unk> Emma soon she would raise her family, when he has a couple and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better to sit down than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person you live now or tell you now when all of all on Facebook begin to walk towards the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do it to work or kill somebody who will be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found out to the roommate room for a prime that worked in a art museum in another state.
This weak tie helped him get a job in there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves his new family, and sending me a letter to say, "Now the public contacts spaces are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who go out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, in the same way, at 21 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even generations in the next generation.
Here's my idea worthy of spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of telling you to <unk> all the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, use your weak differences, choose your family.
They don't get defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They are deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh <unk> in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When the work comes back, it <unk>
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and the learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure very much better.
is the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to university to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios that were <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what they were going to do in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers, working in very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective at improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking them, what about these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these different contexts, we came up with a feature as an important success of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't the I.Q.
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public school schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly more determination than graduation, even when they were <unk> them in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the tests, even the security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> in which it matters purpose. It's also in school, especially for the kids at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we development the determination for children?
What do I have to do to teach kids is a robust job ethic.
How do I keep it motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What do I know is that talent doesn't give it purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't keep ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related or it's even related to the talented ones.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown you that when you read and learn about the brain and how it changes in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to fail, to start to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign one, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes from every character in the right sequence of the answer.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic property.
The first 200 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signs of traffic traffic, <unk> understanding the basic idea of pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you may until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person's arms on both sides, as if I was shouting at a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a pair of <unk> on the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> this person <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a shame as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the <unk>
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- of remember, because a <unk> tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three places together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Get a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already happened for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing as a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the first one, because Japan is in this <unk>
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile is become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and I'll go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film mastered his imagination for months.
Her favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to bring a magic wand
But when you see that movie as many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of a fantasy <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a boy would <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there is a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> magician.
<unk> are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you use magic shoes to defeat the armies of the evil evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most abstract characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And therefore he slid in the room and he was impressed as a foot leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I should feel the sense that Luke is an army for overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does he make Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to <unk> right? And not a world of men that we think is where we are.
Why is there as much financial capital force, force on movies for our children, and so little about the <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know of experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>   I think at the moment of the first kiss. I actually expect that the credits start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess in Disney front of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target audience.
They make a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, and so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all times continues to come up with <unk> every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
So as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism was when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films passes the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not rooted in the root and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had had with a friend of <unk> movie assessment before.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there are more than a female character that will have lines?
So, you have to get the <unk>
These women speak between each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy who are so <unk>  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
I've seen it, and yet I really rarely see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success to <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film is.
<unk> doesn't happen <unk>
And I don't think that it was a lot of the movie -- I don't know if you've seen the movie a lot of film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes from men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go into bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have their <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women who have chosen for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that is going to come up with this room.
The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said,
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually sexually in his life.
I don't think it's a mass entertainment guilt.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music videos or pornography are closely connected, but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you do not do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to get it up.
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I hope that <unk> -- but I have to ask you, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've been reading about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite Star "Star <unk> Do you know what I <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them to achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where it looks like his job is joining a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and better people, like the <unk> magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine -- and one of the things that I was most liked was to look for biscuits of the sea on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was excited about <unk>
I started to see ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love by the past and <unk>
And eventually I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a almost 1.3 miles of length next to <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use <unk>
This is a place in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, simple view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color -- suddenly the place looks like brilliant.
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes in the landscape of the <unk> of construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city -- old city called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that are <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered the city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find out at random that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area pretty high that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborate with Egyptians who are doing <unk> jobs you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation right?
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud we found a dense layer of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> of occupation many hundred years coming dating from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the British Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> layer that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find out here, but we would get to the place in a near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire -- probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the largest <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as it looks like this: TED was not founded in 1984 by 5,000 C.
Do we know that ideas were really started in 1984 B.C. C. in a lost city not for a lot of time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door to <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
And now you get a group of <unk> <unk> on cars.
They are competing on a bike room and they go back to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays on the wheels that ends up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
As you go to the lobby, or what happens to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> with your hand.
on his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you're talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> just making tickle your nose.
You smell the <unk> <unk> and you go into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
Already in the room, and doing maximum imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes and dancing on his middle <unk> singing <unk> I was <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a little yellow way of <unk> and from the oven. It comes to you by <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and Len <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few ladies and different kinds of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers -- just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
It <unk> entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see anyone who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, "You know, when you realized when you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition are saying they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old <unk> techniques.
And my reaction was, <unk> How is it that I hadn't heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English man, although a little <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards live on national T.V.
That will tell the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year -- not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
It was an incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back into the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> books, <unk> <unk>
And by coming back, it was a lot of treaties on memory writing something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory was not as rare as it can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have changed.
They have changed the reserve, and I would say that they have changed our cognitive minds.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are skills like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers at University College University were invited to a study champions in the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will have brains in some way, or a structural way, or different structural from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, you <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, expensive shapes and forms of snow -- they found that in people's memory champions were <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they looked <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament in the competitive <unk> is managing as a armed race in which every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On her desk, I was 36 comic cards that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique he invented and only he <unk>
He used a <unk> technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits binary <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these pitch, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end of the <unk> that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It turns out to a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> he says this: I tell two people who remember the same word, I'm saying to you, <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I went back later, and I ask you to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
You know, what do you do?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said that his work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship anymore.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in their hands.
They were good at getting home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this back and a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired them as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring to a <unk> they would get into a <unk>
He stood up on my foot, and she was <unk> and he was <unk> and as soon as it was -- the <unk> room <unk>
They went to everyone.
But not only killed all of us, but it ripped out the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who there was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to <unk> them.
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he was sitting every <unk>
I took the family out of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were the <unk>
What we <unk> <unk> in that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions -- word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and a remarkable space.
If you tell me that I would give you the first 10 words in the history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby, you would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The more crazy idea, we will think, <unk> and <unk> it is the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first memory <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it memory, the same way that I had made it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're on the door of their house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your home, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they would go in the kitchen, and the fourth subject they would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory memory.
I saw that this was simply fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring.
Seriously, as you see a lot of people sitting on taking exams.
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes all the way before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was entertaining.
I would never expect I was.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is to improve every time more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- I'm willing to imagine <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really stuck with this.
This is me, using my standard standard of training for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security goggles.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered in a year earlier. I had the idea that he could come in in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good enough for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are so just tricks.
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to build any memory <unk> or memory <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory of memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace, these memory skills, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We would take a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most people are not <unk>
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with you today is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short existence in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be from the kind of person to remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it will be just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I was from <unk> culture, I was about six years old, and I lived there in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony who gave the living room.
And then everybody spent the time watching television and so every time I was going out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I came up with me and I went back, and I would go back in a towel and I would all see me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> unsure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and it's not a division of <unk> but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And no wonder we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it, so in a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time for a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and the governments, always are afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> he's got this round thing, columns, red, red -- that leave you with what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of the property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So, how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of the so-called attacking libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we get away from the people.
All of the black -- this will be <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have any other option.
We have to go to the other side and go back to each other <unk> symbols.
So we do, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we are all happy, we do <unk> we make the <unk> coming forward, one and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, <unk> scale.
Really really hard.
So we got to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that they like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add a bake bake and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take closets and we made them <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> that can be <unk>
The ways <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became the columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
madness.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be to the <unk> to the French or the Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They are easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques, we now have new <unk> design techniques, and we find new <unk> some ways that would behave against other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum goes back in the opposite direction.
But then something called a <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and public in general, were completely sure about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism in Bilbao went to a half and a half and a half percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
The whole world wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how do you be able to be able to be able to be able to turn into the world around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around and quickly learned that these forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They made the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium happened with other African architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through the entire architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how are you burning architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> <unk> you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so quickly.
It doesn't really accurate a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a movement of two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen.
My theory is that when you apply it to the media, it starts to <unk> increasingly fast, and to be in both extremes -- almost in <unk> and it will actually make the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
We can now make a symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked exactly like the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting and shared in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media environment, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when we upload these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first of all, <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to the mayor of <unk> people in <unk> and tell them that there is no answer to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are already not those mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and drawings and a complicated, and you don't have a <unk> audience, which is not accepted.
Architects can listen, and you don't leave it by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture history of architecture, and it means that buildings in tomorrow will be very different from today's buildings today.
This means that a public space in the old city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with the foundation of what it should be a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be attached to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve for sports or to <unk> or can you get married in the night.
This means that three architects can vote on the East Side of New York, and raise half a million dollars from the community together around that cause, is no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the more <unk> spaces -- local libraries the homes where we went to our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this in a great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
It was laughing and <unk> and it gives itself those <unk> big <unk>
It's beautiful.
So apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it, and it made me think, "When do I stop doing this?
How do we suddenly be happy with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as a teenager, he just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, despite the fact that her mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells you it's ugly.
Among what her mom tells him, and what her friends, or classmates are saying, you don't know who I believe.
So a video of her himself, she publishes it on YouTube, and he gets to others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager and <unk> which gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They are under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, we have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his fourth <unk>
There is simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being <unk> is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the types of comments that they do.
There is no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what you're rigged with.
What is the hardest thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in one context in every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> remain <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people do?
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the superheroes of sports, and the singers to <unk>
What is the problem with this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, for the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to communicate.
Six of every 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as taxpayers and labor development and labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not <unk> at all the days for the days when they don't feel comfortable on it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see you good enough -- if you don't think that you're sufficiently thin, you give a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about how that looks like.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, the United States and China, and China.
And it comes out regardless of what these young people actually weigh on.
So, to be very clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
<unk> on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are less in the physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that you can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of us who make decisions as well as the consumption of alcohol and of drug and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetic sexual relationships at early ages and no protection and damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they're overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they have no higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe with how they can see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first one is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without knowing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anyone willing to provide your body education to make it work.
An education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and we are a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
The challenge of the status of the women are <unk> and they talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the input from our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of a Olympic athlete is actually dependent on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge the people who are, not because they can see.
We can all start by making it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow up to raise their entire person, valuing <unk> diversity, diversity, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who actually make the difference in a <unk>
So a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be seen from being the ones who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could just be the woman who is at two seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that word <unk> in his interior, that she would tell him for not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were to <unk> this and empower their potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are really excited about us.
But let's bring our children the truth.
I think the way you can see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is, we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They would encourage the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, they become agents of change themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the 5 November of 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League Defense <unk>
It was initially an innocent woman, but being inmate by other people who were in the company of others, started planning on attacks on about 12 icons of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations headquarters and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans was <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1993 of 1993, in the World Trade Center, couldn't be saved.
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving American, elementary school School in the two to give me a happy childhood at all.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims, to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, it doesn't require a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human groups, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that they have to use all the means that everybody lived like them.
A few months before arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last week, he and explained to me that in the last week, he and a few friends, had been going to focus on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shot <unk> which, without knowing our group, was being replaced by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot -- I gave you the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise all of us, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
From such a parent, such a child.
All of us, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later, I understood what it was so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone is time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new side of the class often was the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new of the class silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> for growing under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I would <unk> opera judging people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put up the test my way of thinking, was during the presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been victim <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days to go out to light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe I was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a park of <unk>
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to the development of my character.
All of the life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been a <unk> I developed a sense of empathy for suffering from others, but it was not easy for me to treat <unk> exactly the way as I wish to be <unk>
For that feeling I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is <unk> but I know what it is to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me being <unk> honest about my <unk> and helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has had enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much <unk> energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put into a <unk>
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody's one day, one day, who is trying to get to the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, and I would understand that there is a better way to me, but I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and the loved ones and the losses that terrorism has made them in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism talking, they speak against these meaningless acts, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this view, I put in here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie film.
It's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your <unk>
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that we project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in straightforward.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There is nothing we know about directly.
So I know that I have an <unk>
I don't have certain that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> movies.
Why are we not just robots that are getting to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science for nature, it's objective image.
<unk> to nature, is subjectively.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, <unk> that vision.
The psychology was studying behavior -- the neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is a few questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, they don't go through the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does this be an internal film <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how the <unk> work, how they're <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how that target target.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the function of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we speak, how we talk about, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among simple issues.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied with a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, really still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, she was beating me on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful chain of explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, which explains biology, biology explains a piece of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
And so we don't know how to use that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know that still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are going to be able to deal with <unk> to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem to consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film includes the inner form of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is what you study all that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the legacy of consciousness is satisfying for consciousness.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time we left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks as <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of more basic terms.
On the contrary, they think that the world is constructed.
Sometimes the key list was <unk>
In the 19th century, Barbara discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass law, so he applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, load, and then for logic -- you have to <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect the awareness with other core concepts -- space, time, mass, mass processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want basic laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very fundamental laws that we could put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws they are, but that's what we need.
The second idea crazy is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, the flies, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are intelligent or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of the subjective raw sense of some primitive precursor to your consciousness.
This may sound a little mad for you.
How would anyone think something so crazy?
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful laws of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever you have information processing processing, there's awareness.
<unk> <unk> complex as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a measure of the information integration which calls <unk> which is the degree of information integrated into a system.
And they are supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an environment of information integration as significant as significant, rather important.
But when it comes to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of zero awareness.
It actually takes a fundamental law to <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
They take the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the reality behind us.
As a explains Stephen Hawking's "Where is the fire of <unk>
From view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not beyond the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the middle there.
So this vision, I think, has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, then I had to be a vegan.
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think I think about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have ethical problems that are very serious about the development of the development of intelligent computer systems and the ethics ethic.
And finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED consciousness -- an inner film for this full group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but at least it's a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm safer in the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second crazy idea.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem to science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve this overnight.
But I think we will finally be going to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends, my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful, but there's a obvious problem.
She didn't really get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low under my mother, and I was spending a lot of time looking at the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, so just after about 20 minutes at the 11th of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when I'll give you your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about things that were talking about <unk>
He usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we don't, and it's not the fault of boy, it's a true thing for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our masters or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire me.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair and probably you're waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something -- a <unk> a capital <unk>
Is it a bad thing to live with a disability with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and it can't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You might have seen one of you with a little girl drawing on a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber legs.
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the porn term for <unk> because they <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we <unk> the disability on the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, because of my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that you've lost strange <unk> to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are linked to people with disability at benefit from people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
We did some things.
But the things we <unk> are not the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately by the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of the best of his ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies to raise the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not going to be there sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability every time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
You know, it's a great idea to use some <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that go fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the cell phone on the battery in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and the <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stretch of stairs hasn't made it become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> <unk> an positive attitude to turn all those books to <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who are disability to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of <unk> and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 grade in a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and football reality, with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just answering one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I carry on -- the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and figure out what is running through the game field of 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds would give us trying to relate to all of its being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
I would take some videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the hull, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. Let's take a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
They want that experience.
You know, fans want to be in the field, will be your favorite players, and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into <unk> how we get to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many people already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the <unk> virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh!
No, no, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man in a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before he running and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of fan
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> throwing the ball into the back of the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality, when the funds, the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to gain. You give them money.
So, here's a brief refresher on the technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore got a <unk> to her <unk> to play it faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put signals on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to his group and you see her next show you show you in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that carry <unk> you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties -- as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual strategies <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people on the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
evil will have information <unk>
This is how good people do of the bad ones.
So your team of computing will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being <unk>
It's also for <unk> Who <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the <unk>
They got the ball.
I got an open receptor -- suddenly a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- let you tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you, usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will tell you.
It would lead to the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's an open source.
<unk> the <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor can see in its bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have been followed by every single angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
Do you want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much does this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia or Russia trying to show the world how they're living <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes close.
The questions we do, the choices we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
I was very excited about 23 years of service on the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the <unk> <unk> County -- which includes the bridge <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, it's one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who was able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go down under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact will break bone, some of which we would make vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that we don't normally get stuck in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this method of suicide would realize the death of the death that they were <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, and 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to stop their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year when this young woman talked to an officer talking to her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we succeeded in the day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him about 22 <unk> last year when you get a call of a possible subject -- was sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the <unk> bridge.
Jason had only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had just flown over here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked us if we knew the story of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> mythology created <unk> and he sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out with <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open up the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of intelligent and intelligent kid in New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> damage to suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved a <unk>
What do you say?
What does it mean?
In my experience, you just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't you <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel it, because probably not <unk>
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending life -- you've had these <unk>
I read the person in front of it can save the life and be the turning point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience.
I'm thinking it should go up to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing me more moments of me who really Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19th of January.
It never came there.
I called the <unk> police and <unk> it as they disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and reported that the Mike car car was down the bridge.
A witness had seen it from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and tour the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean by hope and value.
On 11 March of 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible subject on the sidewalk <unk> near the northern tower.
I put my epiphany on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
And when he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and half the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to realize that day again to come back and give her life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, you know?
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he made it <unk> and gave him the hope and life would be <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
You left me to speak and just tell me.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of 11 March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
He was telling Kevin when I was only six months, completely unaware of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writing, <unk> When I visited at General San Francisco Hospital at that night, you would lie like the patient.
I know what I had to be <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that its story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, stealing the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who believe the death wouldn't think of hurt somebody else.
They just want their own <unk> pain.
Usually it gets only three things: you sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was holding my hand on three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And we <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few ones that have jumped from the bridge, and they can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second ones that leave the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be able to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you become on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- no way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally was able to finish my inner truth, with my inner truth.
It makes for complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go later on, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I discovered the past October, I discovered that I'm just getting started.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or because of the beliefs that surround us around us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent -- my agent even ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called <unk>
This is mine.
I had been recorded as a <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in the head.
And my mom was wondering, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> fact but now we know that, really, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped myself share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but how the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
I thank you a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me before me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if you had a <unk> she was responsible for the cost of <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and he was a third <unk> and he was third a <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was about queen of <unk> women but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went into remote provinces of <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. he had moved to San Francisco, and he had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that it passed my heart card to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand at 19 years old.
It's curious that in some of the world's most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to get surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity paper means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears was <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived his truth, but <unk> put in order to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there's no more <unk> of 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. First of all, thank you all of my <unk>
It's my support network, my parents especially to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when I was called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it. I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other not. It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to the birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that would be a block not a block, and there should be a space that will allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The gay movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In many patriarchal societies, and tribal societies, parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who meet her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when their efforts were <unk> in 2011, when the National <unk> <unk> was made so famous a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when when they were born, their birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome to her father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives her <unk> to the mother and no one got a parent.
And a mother would become a lot about having a child.
When you give birth to the first child, the first daughter gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, and she was <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he was born, her third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only mother <unk> but <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of her brothers.
Until age 12 in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he would tell him to go from his home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of her father and his brothers and his brothers and her family, and if we had the code of that of course, honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not just the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl should be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting people's decisions and mother and decisions and the elderly decisions even if they don't will.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like whether or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If you have a very young, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to her daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And a lot of before I was thinking about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and he grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years and a half and a half years and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half,
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a child in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for the <unk> life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they were going to the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was sitting with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've collected all these good values in my school and girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
It takes millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper diary for the BBC, the BBC, she was offered herself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and at 9 a.m., 2012, was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would read to my <unk> <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please don't <unk>
They have a fair cause.
<unk> your life in the cause of the truth, by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't get to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and I had harsh headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that would be held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to myself, "I'm okay with my smile with my smile and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we got stuck.
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that even though it's an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like every 16 <unk>
<unk> when he didn't do his job.
You fight her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special about my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google <unk> -- the <unk> of Google visualization. The <unk> of the Google <unk> <unk> but all the work I talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You're still the same as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't matter gray, but it was the <unk> dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a number of take, of more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to live alive.
Over once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would go to try to get the <unk> dose, because you really don't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the ugly dose -- my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think about my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I took doses and chemicals and chemical chemicals for an early <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking about the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past several types like this, or maybe some <unk> versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was actually <unk> a problem I had on the front, and it just wasn't going to happen.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to be <unk> Since then I get better on the men.
What I was trying to do is how to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> think of almost always in imagery, and that became my point of key reference to how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get to <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, to me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to the <unk> thought and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> actually <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get very quickly these mental imagery of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty getting to do this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to doing this with two recent experiments that were done by two other groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology and functional MRI imaging to represent the brain, you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of the brain that same individual while you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the left column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab, in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of feedback on the brain in the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new animals, new animals, and as long as it became a new <unk>
The computer using only brain information is scanning the scanning thing to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up <unk>
We're pretty close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, you believed in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning brain systems, available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do this?
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and you put electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of them are proposing new projected techniques by images, even I think that with the recent result of the MRI outcome, we must first ask the next, this technology will be the end of the way around.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, <unk> magnets only offered little improvements in resolution is not increasing increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make these big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and bright solutions and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> frequency recipients in the MRI machine.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field, they are <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> at the frequencies of the radio <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have few choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it takes much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay self.
I think we all have <unk>
And her self may be telling someone for the first time that your love or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who's cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have through your life.
So I think it's a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> he gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope with the <unk> of my pants <unk> and by having my head <unk> my head -- I would just ask you a kid to say, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear very awkward silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold, look at her son.
But I would say nothing and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get out of the women with the women at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," I would <unk>
And so I took my focus on and I went down and I went down and down and my backs a little girl with a little girl in pink looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're boy or <unk>
And so I took a lot of it back again -- I got out of <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw my boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a <unk> <unk>
Because I'm more of the kind of girl from a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- it's just <unk> You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some plans in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how it feels living in a closet.
That's how my self is not different from you or you or yours or yours.
Let me give you a hundred reasons for why I came out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> the hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared to <unk> it is harder to say that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I'm telling you is harder than telling your three-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We need to stop what is hard to do with what is difficult for someone to make us feel better or worse in relation to our innovators, and we need to only feel empathy because we all live in a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make it security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made out of your walls, a disappointment is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine himself 20 years ago.
I, that had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant gay gay <unk> to fight for any four-year-old who would go into coffee.
I was frozen in fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and moving only one muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who have spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't spears that <unk> will kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was on my sister.
It was the first time that many among guests knew that it was gay, and by doing my lady <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to one where my friends were friends, people I knew years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I laughed at <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the gay account battle had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> Do you meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> program.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing you desperately their support, to make me know that I was out of my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts for me.
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the missile <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
What else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations still remain without my strong point.
Ask anyone that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay, but you'll understand that what it involves getting out of anything is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready to battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the other ones need to know that they are also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If you say their parents who may be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be confused by that.
And some can be wounded by wounded as well as they have done, but I'm never comfortable with what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but your own.
That's the story of them, but not you are.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark talk, a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
Did you know what that is?
If you look at the story of what the intelligence has seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this he did it as a criticism of computer pioneers as Alan Turing like.
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
So first we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth and the Earth's intelligence or you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, like <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the intelligence on Earth, would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that we would take on the surface of a <unk> planet stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there's been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to development of intelligence, and in particular, for development of universal states that restore the diversity of possible future diversity.
Finally, in a robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of doing complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for several years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a glass force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, accessible, to an imminent time future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the energy choices.
And so having on this equation, it is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How do you think about it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence has a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior isn't only correlated with the production of the long term, but actually it comes out directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you can find it.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple human intelligence testing, play with humans, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the same thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He simply decided to make it balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human health technologies.
This ability to use tools will have smart manufacturing applications and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a model version of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where friends are constantly being <unk> and keeps the good network connected to us.
This same capacity for online <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term <unk> the piece -- the play <unk> there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in it.
The machines will become against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from <unk> rather than being backwards.
Another important implication is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you find targets are going to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants to go through the descendants to help you build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of the stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how it fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one between the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and put a little bit of that light that you get in.
The data gathered by Kepler show the planets of planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
And together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth Earth of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At their time, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this wealth of potentially <unk> worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, he was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale -- have moved our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist of the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property system.
Now, as someone really interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more we look for planets like Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the first first world and the planets that we know that our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission to take samples of the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies are now providing not just short space flights but also the chance to live on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> they remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas that are linked to ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty awful place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left in <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen filled by our tropical forests than thousands of miles away.
I worry about the colonization of Mars and the other planets going on with it a huge and sad <unk> the implication of the Mars and the belief that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly <unk> Earth.
For a lot that you like the <unk> exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to make humanity as to imagine that the captain of the Titanic is going to tell us that the party actually will be later in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and earth preservation are not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi I asked myself to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the existence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important to protect the origin of the planets that are going to development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization we will save us from ourselves, but the global preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put ourselves to the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
So a few years ago, I was holding my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where there was <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very well.
I thought to call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe at the next morning, and my passport <unk>
<unk> expensive, but they're sure not more expensive than a <unk> at average night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was very high in it.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thought.
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in place, that <unk> that bad things happen.
Or at least if bad things happen, you will make the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe going on.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what it came wrong, yeah?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not that <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you get a place for the things you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to do a location of the important things, where the good, where the fish, places where the fish places are <unk> where the female tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows them to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that are not moving much, not so good for things that move so much.
This is the reason to lose keys in the car, <unk> <unk>
So at home, they took a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For his <unk> a particular drawer for it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it all these things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take your mobile phone, a picture of your credit cards license to <unk> <unk> <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
